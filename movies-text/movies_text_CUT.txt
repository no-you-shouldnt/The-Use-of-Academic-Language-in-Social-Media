Well , you did n't fall for that farm life , did you ? I should say not . I had to slave for all of them . Was all right till my mother died but I was only a poor relation , you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl . Oh , what a life on that farm out in Minnesota . With them Swedes , woman-hungry . One night I was alone in the house and one of the sons came back . After that , I hated them , so I 'd kill them all if I stayed so I ran away . St . Paul .

I never could stand being caged up nowhere . I got good and sick , and they had to send me to the hospital . And it was nice there . I was sorry to leave it , honest . If my old man does n't help me it 's men again . Men all the time . Oh , how I hate them , every mother 's son of them . Do n't you ? Well , there 's good one's and there 's bad one's , you know . Now , your old man , old Chris . Oh , he 's a good one , honest . Well , he 'll have to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he 's kind of simple . He 's got nutty notions .

Bet you ca n't even hit the net . - Yeah , how about a home run , Babe Ruth ? - Sure , I dare you to . With one throw , I could knock them dames off of their bunks . Go to it , big boy . Do n't overlook me , carrot top . I have the shape that makes the old men young and the young men old . - Attaboy . - Mama wants Papa . - Papa wants Mama . Some mamas too . Now somebody else . Somebody that packs a mean right . What we want this time is a regular he-man . You shut up or I 'll wrap you around the target . Do n't get sore , big boy .

Oh , sure , Anna , you 're crazy about me , and I 'm not after blaming you . You just hate yourself , do n't you , Matt ? Oyster loaf for the lady , sir . - I ordered milk for the lady . - Well , I 've got it here . Well , let 's drink to our good health . Here 's to you .

But if I 'm needing sugar , I know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . Just like a couple of kids . Sure , Anna , when you 're in love , you ai n't got the brains of a tick . What do you mean , love ? You know what I mean , Anna . It 's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue . A man like me ai n't given to loving a woman . He knows too much about them . Every color of them , from here to the China Sea . The whole lying , cheating smear of them . Sailors ' bait . When he comes across a girl like you , Anna that 's as clean as a shell . You 're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over . Anna , what 's come over you ? Oh , nothing . Sure , do n't lie to me , Anna . You 're as stiff as a corpse . Hello , dearie . - Well , I 'll be ... - Well , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm afraid I do n't remember you . - She do n't remember me . - Of course she do n't , you old scab . - Beat it , or I 'll have you thrown in the brig . - No , Matt , maybe I do know her . That old sea cow ? Go on , clear out of here . You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you . A nice young ... ? A nice young ... Pure and white as a lily . Shut up , or I 'll choke the wind out of your gullet . Oh , Matt , let her alone . She do n't mean nothing by it . Anna . Anna , darling . You see what you 've done ? You frightened her . - Go on , clear out of here . - I 'm going , I 'm going . Let her alone . Do n't go . I was lying , Matt . I know her and she knows me . I recognized her the minute she stepped across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to spill over for nobody . You ai n't responsible for what your old man does . I 'll tell you why she did n't want to talk to me . Because I 'm a tramp , that 's why . And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it . Yeah , he did n't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl . Well , it ai n't so , though , Matt . She 's lying . Lying , I 'm ly ... ? Well , I like your nerve , all right , all right . Gee , I 'm sorry I came here to speak to you . Insulting me . Well , can you beat it ? I 'll be toddling along . I 'm glad you found yourself such a nice , friendly gent . I hope you 're happy , kid . I 'm sorry I bothered you , honest , I ... Oh , forget it , Ann . You only got one life to live .

Sure , the world 's full of them . I know it 's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself , darling . What would you say , Matt , if I told you that ... ? Say what , me darling ? Tell me what . Oh , nothing . Sure , I know what you 'll be wanting to tell me soon , if not this minute that you love me . Do n't be so sure of yourself , Matt . I 'm loving nobody . And you 'll be wanting to marry me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt . You want to marry me ? - Honest ? - Sure , I 'll marry you . Only , do n't be putting me to too many tests , or I might change me mind . I 'm tired , Matt . I wan na go back to the barge . You ... You think you love that sailor fella , Anna ? Well , what if I do ? You think maybe you marry him ? No . I 'm glad you do n't marry sailor , Anna . Is bad for woman . They do n't never see their men only once in long while . You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more . Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool , I tell you . Your mother , she tell you same thing if she was alive . Well , that ai n't why I wo n't marry him . I 'm not thinking about myself but about him . He 's such a simple guy , a big kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You fool him ? Oh , you go crazy , I think . I 've been thinking I was myself the last few days . I 'll be outside . I love to watch the ships passing . When Matt comes along , tell him where I am , will you ? All right , I tell him . Well , God bless who 's here . How 's the world treating you this afternoon , Anna 's father ? Oh , pretty good , if it ai n't for some fellas . Meaning me , do you ? Well , if you ai n't the funny old crank of a man . Where 's herself ? - Where 's Anna , I 'm after asking you . - She gone out to look on boat . Well , I 'll be going out to her . But before I go , I 'll take this chance while we 're alone to have a word with you . And that word is soon done . I 'm marrying your Anna before this day is out . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or no . That 's easy for saying . You mean I wo n't ? Is it yourself is after stopping me , do you think ? - I stop it if it come to worst . - Sure , it is n't trouble I 'm looking for . You 're her father . Would n't it be a shame for us to be at each others ' throats like a pair of dogs , and I married to Anna . So out with the truth , man alive . What is it you 're holding against me at all ? I do n't want my Anna for got married . Listen , you fella . I 'm old man . I do n't see my Anna for 15 year . She 's all I got in the world . You think now when she come on first trip , I want her for leave me alone again ? Sure , let you not be thinking I 've no heart at all for the way you 'd be feeling . Then you do right thing , eh ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big fella like you on sea , he do n't need a wife . He got new girl in every port , you know that . Oh , shut up . Sure , there 's a time come to every man , on sea or land when he 's sick of the lot of them cows , and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine , decent girl and building a home to call his own , rearing up children in it . Sure , Anna 's the one woman in the world for me and I ca n't live without her now , I 'm thinking . You think I 'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother 's was made by me ? No , she do n't marry you . Not if I have to kill you first . Glory be to God , what talk from a stumpy runt of a man . It is queer fool 's blather you have , about the sea done this and the sea done that . You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sailor . I 'm hearing a lot from you , and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her . I 'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are . Not a man at all . You see if I 'm man maybe quicker than you think . You know the truth in your heart . The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down . You 're not man enough to get up for another , but you lie there howling murder . I 'd like to see you in the best of your youth . - Do what I done in the storm and after . - Why , you young fool , you . In old days , when I was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that . Ships were ships then , and men what sailing them real men . What you got on steamers now ? You got fellas on deck do n't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck , you got fellas just know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon ashore , you . Is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are , you old ape ? One of them is worth any 10 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag . - You Irish swine . - So you do n't like the Irish , you old baboon ? Sure , it 's that you 're needing in your family . An Irishman . A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you 'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself . Sure , old men getting childish should n't play with knives . Faith , I 've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head . Keep away from me , now . Hello , Matt . Are you here already ? Say , what 's up ? How did that chair get knocked over ? Oh , Matt , you have n't been fighting with him , after you promised ? I 've not laid a hand on him , Anna . I told him to his teeth I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it . He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes . I know it 's true , Matt . Do n't you mind what he says . God bless you . And then I said I thought maybe you 'd have a bit of love for me too . So you told him that ? Maybe I have . I 've been wondering if I do love you . I did n't want to , I must own up to that . But I ... I guess I ca n't help it , so I guess I do . Oh , sure , I do , Matt . What 's the use of kidding myself different ? - Sure , I love you . - God be praised . And I have n't ever loved a man in my life before , never . Faith , we 'll be having a grand , beautiful life together to the end of our days . Matt . - Goodbye , Matt . - Goodbye , is it ? I 'll be coming at you in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man when you 're beat fair and square . Here 's me hand to you . We 'll be friends from this out . No , I do n't shake hands with you , fella . Not while I live . The back of me hand to you , then , if that suits you . It 's a rotten bad loser you are , devil mend you . No , I do n't lose . Anna said she like you little bit . But you do n't hear her say she marry you , I bet . No , and I do n't hear her say the sun is shining , either . - No , I did n't say it , Matt . - There , you hear ? You 're waiting to be asked , you mean ? Well , I 'm asking you now . We 'll be wedded this day , with the help of God . - You heard what I said after I kissed you . - I do n't remember . I said goodbye . That kiss was for goodbye , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We 've said goodbye , that 's all . - I knew that was so . - Is it making game of me you 'd be ? It 's a queer time to joke with me . Do n't be doing it , for the love of God . You do n't think I 'd kid you now . I 'm not joking , Matt . I mean what I say . You do n't . You ca n't . It is mad you are , I 'm telling you . - No , I 'm not . - What 's come over you so sudden ? You were saying you love me . I 'll say that as often as you want me to . It 's true . But why ? What ? What is it ? Because it 's the best way I can figure out , Matt . I 've been thinking it over and thinking it over , day and night , all week . Oh , do n't think it is n't hard on me too , Matt . Well , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us has love ? I 'm thinking it 's listening to that old fool you are him hating me , filling your ears full of lies against me . Yes , Anna believe me , not you . She know her old father do n't lie like you . You sit down , do you hear ? Why do you come butting in and making things worse ? You 're like a devil , you are . Here I was , beginning to like you , beginning to forget all the things I 've held up against you . - You ai n't got nothing for hold against me . Have n't I , though ? Well , let me tell you . Matt , I 'm surprised at you . - You did n't think anything he 'd said ... - Sure , what else would it be ? Tell me , and do n't keep me waiting . I ca n't tell you , and I wo n't . I 've got a good reason , that 's all you need to know . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . So for heaven 's sake , let 's talk of something else . No , I 'll not . - Is it married to someone else you are ? - I should say not . You 're like them women ca n't make up their minds till they 're drove to it . Well , I 'll make up your mind for you . We 've had enough talk . Let 's go to the other room and dress in your best . We 're going ashore . - She do n't do that . - Where do you get that stuff ? Never mind , get on with your dressing . - We 'll see who 'll win in the end , me or you . - Stay , Anna . She will not . She 'll do what I say . You 've had your hold on her long enough . - It 's my turn now . - Your turn ? What am I anyway ? Never mind what you are . It 's what you 're gon na be : Wedded to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one thing he say ! - She will ! - I 'm her father . - She will in spite of you . She 's taking my orders from now on , not yours . Orders is good . Never mind now . We 've no time to be wasting . - Do you hear what I 'm telling you ? - No , stay here , Anna ! You can go to blazes , both of you . You 'd think I was a piece of furniture . I 'll show you . Sit down . Sit down , do you hear ? Let me talk for a minute . You 're all wrong , see ? I 'm gon na tell you two something , and then I 'm gon na beat it . I 've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland . I was n't going to tell you , but you 've forced me into it . Oh , what 's the use ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way as any other . Do n't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reason I got as long as I was n't married already . That 's me word , and I 'll stick to it . You make me laugh , honest . Wan na bet you will ? You wait and see . You was going on as if one of you had to own me . But nobody owns me , see , excepting myself . I 'll do what I please . And no man , I do n't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do . I ai n't asking either of you for a living . I 'll make it myself , one way or another . I am my own boss . Now , put that in your pipe and smoke it . - You and your orders . - I was n't meaning it that way at all and well you know it . You 've no call to raise this rumpus with me . - It is him , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you , you did mean it that way . You sounded just like all the rest . It is queer , rough talk , that , for a decent girl the like of yourself . Decent . Who told you I was ? I 'm talking to you now . I do n't want to hear . You go out your head , I think . Well , living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut . Your bunk about the farm being so fine . Did n't I write you , year after year , how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me ? What did you care ? Nothing . Not even enough to come out and see me . Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea do n't go down with me . You just did n't want to be bothered with me . - Oh , that ai n't so , Anna . - But one thing I never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was none of my fault . I hated him and he knew it . But he was big and strong , like you . That 's why I ran away from the farm . That 's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St . Paul . You think that was a nice job for a girl , too , do n't you ? With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me . They were n't looking for marrying . You do n't say nothing . Either one of you . But I know what you 're thinking . You 're just like all the rest . And who 's to blame for it ? Me or you ? If you 'd been a regular father and had me with you things would 've been different . - Do n't talk that way . - I go crazy . I wo n't listen to you . - You will listen . You , keeping me safe inland . I was no nurse girl the last two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , that 's what . Yes , that kind of a house . The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too . And all men . I hate them , I hate them ... - Oh , it 's a lie , Anna , it 's a lie ... - So that 's what 's in it . I suppose you remember your promise . No other reason was to count with you as long as I was n't married already . You want me to get dressed and go ashore , do n't you ? Oh , yes , you do . I suppose if I tried to tell you that I was n't that no more you 'd believe me , would n't you ? And if I told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I 've been through was n't me , did n't count it was just like it never happened you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , I 'm sure , if I told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards , seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life . And I sized you up as different from the one's on land , as water is from mud . I could n't marry you with you believing a lie . And I was ashamed to tell you the truth . And now , give me a bawling-out and beat it like I can tell you 're going to . Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has made me clean ? It 's straight goods , honest . Oh , yes , you will . You 're just like all the rest . The rest , is it ? My curse on you . Clean , is it ? Oh , do n't , Matt . Get out of here . Let me alone . Get out of here ! I 'll be going . And I 'll be drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours off me lips ! And I 'd be getting dead , rotten drunk so I 'll not remember you at all ! I 'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world , where I 'll never see your face again ! - Oh , do n't go . It 's better Anna marry you ... - Let go of me , you old ape ! Marry her , is it ? I 'd see her dead at me feet first . I 'm shipping away out of this , I 'm telling you . My curse on you , and the curse of all the saints . - I go ashore too . - Not after him , I tell you . Do n't you dare . Oh , I go for get drink . I 'm driving you to drink too , huh ? You wan na get drunk so you can forget , like him . Aye . You think I like hear them things ? Oh , Anna . Anna , I think you was n't that kind of girl . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want me here disgracing you , I suppose . Oh , no , no , Anna . You stay here . It ai n't your fault , I know that . It 's that old devil do this to me . It was all right on barge , with just you and me . Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog . That fella , he do n't never come , you do n't never tell me them things . I do n't never know . Then everything is all right . Oh , that dirty devil sea . Oh , what 's the use ? Go ashore and get drunk . You wait here , Anna ? Maybe . Maybe not . Maybe I 'll get drunk too . Maybe I 'll ... 0h , what do you care what I do ? Go on and beat it . It 's foggy outside . Oh , God . - What 's the trouble ? Feeling sick ? - Inside my head feels sick . Oh , Anna , you think maybe sometime you forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Oh , Anna lilla . Oh , do n't bawl about it . There ai n't nothing to forgive anyway . It ai n't your fault , it ai n't mine . It ai n't his , neither . I fix everything all right for you and me , Anna . Yes ? Then you and me will stick together ? We 'll work for each other and help each other , huh ? - What is it you fixed ? - Well , I sign on steamer Londonderry . Sail for Cape Town tomorrow . Oh , Anna , I only bring you bad luck . That 's how you fix me , is it ? Well , I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone , then . Oh , ca n't you see that you 're doing the same thing that you 've always done ? Ca n't you see that ? Oh , what 's the use of talking ? You ai n't right . I 'll never blame you anymore . Oh , Anna . You forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . You 're just what you are , like me . And you , you let me kiss you once again , eh ? - Oh , sure , no hard feelings . - Oh , Anna lilla . I ca n't say it , Anna . I think I go lie down , go to sleep . Oh , that booze , he do n't go well , Anna . I think I 'm never going to drink again . I ca n't stand this much longer . What am I waiting for , anyhow , like a darn fool ? Anna ? - Anna ? - Yes , what do you want ? Do n't say it . I know what 's in your mind . Yes , that 's what I was , and that 's what I 'm going back to . I 'd kill you first . And finish it up . It 's a dog 's life I been living since I found out what you are . Oh , why do n't you leave me alone . Go away . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep kicking me for ? Do n't you deserve the worst I 'd say , God forgive you ? All right , maybe I do . But do n't rub it in . Why have n't you done what you said you were going to ? Ship away to the other side of the earth , where you do n't have to see me . - I have . - What ? You 're going away , honest ? I signed on , drunk as I was , and she 's sailing tomorrow . - Where is she going ? Far away ? - Cape Town . It is at the end of Africa . That 's far for you . - What 's the boat 's name ? - The Londonderry . The Londonderry ? Oh , this is too much . Faith , I do n't blame you for laughing at me . True , it is the fool of the world I am to come back to talk to you at all . Oh , what 's the use ? What 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna ... Anna , if I could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for , I could be forgetting the rest , maybe . Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love , with them ? You fool , you . I 've stood enough from you . Love them , is it ? I hated them , I tell you . And may God strike me dead , and my mother too , if she was alive if I 'm not telling you the honest truth . Oh , sure , Anna , if I could only be believing you , now . Why , Matt , you 've got to believe it . What can I do ? What will I do to prove to you I 'm not lying ? Anna , would you ... ? Would you be willing to swear an oath , a terrible , fearful oath ? Oh , sure , I will , Matt , on anything . Would you swear on this ? Oh , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me by me mother , God rest her soul . And I 'm telling you , it has great power in it . And I 'm warning you now , if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who 'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie . I would n't have the nerve , honest , Matt , if it was a lie . But it 's the truth , and I ai n't scared to swear it . Give it to me . What do you want me to swear ? You say it . Swear I 'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for . I swear it . I swear it by God . And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you 're lying . And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I 'm lying . Oh , glory be to God , I 'm after believing you now . - Now what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , why ? - Oh , God pity me . Sure , it 's some devil 's treachery in it . You swearing on a Catholic cross , and you one of the others . - Well , do n't you believe me , Matt ? - Oh , but if it ai n't a Catholic you are ... I ai n't nothing , Matt . What 's the difference ? Did n't you hear me swear ? I 'm afraid I love you , God forgive me , no matter what you are . I 'd be going mad if I 'd not be having you . I 'd be killing the world . We 'll be wedded this day . And we 'll be happy , the two of us , in spite of the devil . Well , we got ta have a drink on this , my good man . - Blast you . - That 's the way to talk . Oh , Matt , it 's time for you two to kiss and make up . You 'll be shipmates on the Londonderry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Aye , and I 'm boatswain on her . The devil ! You 'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again , will you ? It 's all right , Matt . That 's where he belongs , and I want him to go . You 've got ta go too . We 'll need the money . And as for me being alone , why , that runs in the family and I 'll get used to it . I 'll get a house somewhere and I 'll make a regular place for you two to come back . And now you 'll drink and be friends , huh ? Sure . - Here 's luck to you . - Skoal . Well , you 'll not be lonesome long . I 'll see to that , God willing . Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot , I tell you . - Maybe twins . - Oh , quit your kidding . Is it any religion at all you have , you and your Anna ? Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Oh , then I 'm damned entirely . Oh , well , what 's the difference ? It is God 's will anyhow . It 's queer , you and me shipping on same boat that way .

Why , gee , Matt , you ai n't agreeing with him , are you ? Come on . Here 's to the sea , no matter what . Be a game sport , man . Drink to that . Fog , fog all time .

Who did this terrible thing ? Take your seats . I 'm going to find out who did this . I would hate to think that one of my little girls would do such a thing . Do n't look at me , teacher .

Go to the kitchen where you belong . Do n't drop that jam on the floor . Go on . Pa ! Stop it ! You 've whipped him enough ! He did n't mean to be bad .

Of course , this is a tremendous surprise for everybody . We 've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you 're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , do n't you put it off on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I 've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That 's great ! What is it , Pa ? I do n't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards . Right ? Right . The happiest moment in a woman 's life is when she feels for the first time her baby 's arms around her neck . No word 's fine enough to describe it ! And the pride and happiness to see him grow up .

Now children , I know you 're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ai n't New York , but it 's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he 's just got a natural sense of humour . - I 'm so disappointed Phyllis could n't come . - She sends you her love , Ma .

That tells the story . - You old ... - Thanks for the booze . - They do n't call in that . - You mean you find it out soon enough . Ca n't something be done about this before it 's too late . Everybody makes mistakes , that 's why the train stops at Reno . Do n't say that . It may turn out alright . Pa should have had a circus . His family is full of clowns .

Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I 'll be in in just a minute , mother dear .

You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you ca n't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I 'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let 's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we could n't do that . The stuff is here and they 'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I 'll unload the stuff . You go on home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything to happen to you . - That 's alright , go on home . - I did n't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What 's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you need n't bother at all . Everything 's all ready . Where 's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben !

Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we 're all having breakfast together .

I hope it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It 's Johnny . - Johnny ? What 's happened to him ? - He is n't hurt ! - He 's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you 're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I do n't believe you ! I ca n't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I 'll show you . - I 'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He 's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It 's only a small fine . It is n't even serious . An officer was shot ! That 's serious , is n't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny would n't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he 's not upstairs ! And his bed has n't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny 's been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? - Why do n't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You 've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you 've got ? - None , to speak of . It 's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything 's going to be alright . - She 's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Ca n't you see ? There is n't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you 're not trying to do a thing . Why do n't you talk to the lawyer ? - I have n't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you 're shielding someone . - You 're crazy . - I ca n't understand it . Did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay for it , did it ? I 'll take it back . - I 'm sorry about that . - It does n't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , does n't it ? Johnny , I do n't believe you did it ! I wo n't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There 's no doubt about that . Of course , it would n't have been so bad , only they took the car and do n't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Do n't you gamble your future on me . Do n't wait . There 're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I do n't want you to come here again . I do n't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they 've done it . They 've convicted him . Three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've got to do something . We 've got to ! We ca n't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We 've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I could n't tell him anything . I always say : " As ye sow , so shall ye reap " . You can keep them old bars . I do n't want them where I 'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ai n't got enough juice around here . Where they 're gon na take me , they 're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let 's go . I 'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You ca n't go on like this . I 've got to , it 's killing me . I ca n't eat , I ca n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for me . - I 'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You 've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I 'll be away wo n't mean a thing . I 'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She 's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I 've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you do n't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he is n't . You 'll always love him , stand by him , wo n't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I 've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be hungry . You 're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He 's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it 's awfully hard to realize that Pa 's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why do n't you go and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could n't bring myself to give up the old home . I do n't mind working , I like it . Besides , it 's good for me . You 're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why do n't you ? I could n't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why did n't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That 's just why I did n't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I 'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I 'm full right up to here . I 've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I have n't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What 's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you 're crying . I ca n't help it . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Johnny , you have n't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I 'm wrong , but I 've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You ca n't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , ca n't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why do n't you say that in the first place ? - Do n't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that 's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I 've got some great plans . I 've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It wo n't be any time at all before I 'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That 's the tough part of it . I do n't know how to tell her . - Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they would n't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered " Jailbird " . Johnny , you must n't go . Do n't you see ? I ca n't stay here . I 'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma 's getting old , Isaac . That 's the tough part of it . Of course , I have n't made things any too easy for her . You have n't made the things too easy for any of us . It 's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I 'll send money for her every month . I 'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Is n't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why did n't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac 's been so worried about me , he thought it 's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it 's good to see you , Ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye .

Oh , Daddy , I had a dream last night . I dreamed Mommy and you were putting me to bed . And do you remember how you used to tell me fairy tales ? - Come on , honey child . - First Mother-What is it , Uncle Billy ? What 's the matter , Uncle Billy ? Why does everybody act so funny ?

Did something happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how you must always think of it- that Mama 'll never be ill again ... or frightened or discouraged . She 'll never suffer anymore .

There has n't been a Yankee patrol through here since morning . There 's bound to be one soon . Get Miss Virgie 's things ready . - You mean , you 're gon na take Miss Virgie with you , Massa Cary ? - Yes . - Through the Yankee line ? - I 've got to get her to my sister in Richmond . - But , Captain , it 's dangerous .

Rosabelle , you go with them and see that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch . - Yes , sir . - Come , honey . - Do n't talk now . Well , I did n't know- I did n't know that hole was there . Honey , do you remember how Mama always taught you never to tell a lie ? - Oh , I never have , Daddy . - I know , and Mama 's proud of you for it . But if those Yankees should come in here , you 've got to tell them a lie . - You want me to tell a lie ? - Just this once , honey , for Daddy 's sake . And in a case like this , it really is n't a lie . If they should stop here and they ask you ... tell them I was here but I left an hour ago , and you saw me cross the river . Now be a brave little Confederate , darling . Do this for me . - Daddy . - Hmm ? - Would General Lee want me to tell that lie ? - Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a whopper . They 's comin ' , Massa Cary ! Here , help me with this . Do n't be frightened . Act as though you did n't know they were here . All right , Massa Cary . Put that table back up against the wall . Remember now , act as though nothing had occurred . Dance or play or something . We will , Daddy . - What you all doin ' ? - You got your mouth organ ? - Yeah . - Well , get ready to use it . Sergeant , take your men and search that wood . Cary 's around here , and this time we 've got to get him . He 's given us the slip long enough . - Hurry now . Move fast . - Yes , sir .

No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Yes , sir . My daddy was here , but he left an hour ago . - Is that so ? - Yes , sir . He was here .. . but he left an hour ago , and I saw him cross the river . Well , now , that 's very interesting . I know another dance . Oh , yes , sir . She know a lot of dances . Now , dance for the gentlemen , honey child . What was your father doing here ? My mommy was very sick , and she kept asking for Daddy . So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him ... and this morning my mommy went away . - Is that true ? - Yes , sir . I 'm sorry . But my daddy says I must always think of it as beautiful . Your daddy 's right . You see , I have a little girl , too , just about your age ... and I 'd feel awful sorry if her mommy went away . - Has your little girl got a pony ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and everything ? You had the table out in the center of the room , eh ? - No , sir . - No , sir . - What are those tracks ? - I made them with my foot . Is that a trapdoor in the ceiling there ? No , sir . There ai n't nothing up there . Nothing at all , sir . - You 've been lying to me . - No , sir , I haven't . - Your father 's here now ! - No , sir , he is n't ! - You know he is ! - He was here , but he left an hour ago . - I saw him cross the river . - You tell me the truth , or I 'll give you the worst-- Just a minute ! - Drop your pistol . Now , come down and keep your hands up . Back over against that door . Turn around and keep those hands up . Daddy . All right , you can drop them now , but no funny business . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? Yes , you did , darling . Daddy 's proud of you . I said just what you told me to . You were perfect , and I was only fooling about the whipping . I really was n't going to . Run outside , darling . Daddy 'll call you . Come on , Uncle Billy . Can you arrange so that my arrest wo n't frighten her ? - I 'll try . - Thanks . - Any papers on you ? - No , I 'm not scouting this trip , Colonel . I came home to bury my dead ... and take my little girl to Richmond , where my sister is . I see . Well , come on . Let 's get it over with . I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye . I understand . Will you tell her I 've gone back to General Lee ? I 'll return soon . - Yes , it would just about fit . - What ? - The Yankee uniform . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Well . I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves . If you stole that uniform , I do n't know how I could stop you . - You mean-- If you were wearing a Union uniform ... and had a pass through the lines ... you 'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond . - Where would I get a pass ? - From me . I do n't think my country expects me to make war on babies . I do n't know what to say . Of course , you realize what it means if you 're caught in my uniform . Are n't you taking an awful chance yourself , Colonel ? War 's full of chances . I wo n't forget this . I hope you get through . - God bless you . - There 's just one thing I ask . In passing through our lines , whatever you see or hear , forget . My word of honor . Daddy , Daddy ! The soldiers are coming back ! Get out the back way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Yankee man gon na be nice ? A man could n't be nicer than he 's been . You see , you 've made me think of my little girl . - I knew all the time you were n't gon na whip me . - Come on . We 've got to hurry . Good luck . You 're nice enough to be a Confederate . Good-bye , Uncle Billy . - Any sign of him ? - Not a thing , Colonel . Well , you men better come in and warm up . There 's a fire in here . Yes , sir . - No trace at all , eh ? - No . But I 'm sure he 's still around here . They buried his wife just an hour ago . Look ! There goes somebody . - A man and a child ? - Yes . They 're headed for the woods . That 's a slave and his pickaninny . They just left here . They 're all right . - Do you hear anything ? - Horses . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man give you a paper to show them , Daddy ? Yes , but the Yanks around here may recognize me . I do n't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood . This is n't a good neighborhood anyway . No . Come on . - Halt ! - Whoa ! - Where are you going , sir ? - I 'm taking this child to her father just beyond our lines . Colonel Morrison sent me . Here 's a pass . Have you got a little girl , mister ? No , I 've got a boy . - Where 'd you come from ? - Cary 's plantation . Left there at noon . - Why are n't you using the main road ? - Full of artillery .

I do n't know why it is n't a sin to do any of the things we do in war . What 's the 72nd Vermont ? Well , that 's a regiment of soldiers I have no intention of meeting . Halt ! Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg . - Here 's his pass . - Colonel Morrison ? - Yes . - Where was he ? Cary plantation , about 1 8 miles south of_here . - When did you leave there ? - Why-- We left there at 1 2:00 . - Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I 'm six years old .

That child has literally captured us all . - Colonel-- Yes , I know . I heard you . No chance at all , eh ? No . And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too ? I 'm sorry , Colonel . He 's innocent , Major . All he did was try to help a child . The evidence we could n't overcome , Colonel ... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform . - I stole that uniform . - We could n't make them believe that . I had hoped we could . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want done . Thank you , Major . Well , it was a gamble , and we lost . I have no regrets .

Well , the world is full of names . They could have picked out any other name . - Who could ? - Whoever did . - I do n't know who it was . - Man , what are you talkin ' about ? Why is a shoe called a shoe ? Massa Cary says that shows you got brains when you 're thinkin ' ' bout things . I spent all day yesterday thinkin ' , why is a horse called a horse ?

I expects they take him out pretty soon now . Last night when I said my prayers ... I asked God to let Daddy out of there ... and- and I asked him for a new dress too . Then I thought maybe that was too much to ask ... so I told God he did n't have to bother about the dress . - Was that right , Uncle Billy ? - Yes , that was right , honey . But if you want that dress ... I 'll kinda slip a little hint in my prayers tonight . Now , Uncle Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you did yesterday , I 'll never take you again .

Yes , sir . Did you like it , Daddy ? You have charge of Captain Cary 's little girl , have n't you ? Yes , sir . I is one of his slaves , sir . - I want to speak to you a moment . - Yes , sir . That was lovely , darling . Come on now , and tell me what you 've been doing . Oh , I sewed up a hole in my dress . Mrs .

When she was so nice , and Colonel Morrison 's so nice , and Mrs . Robin ... why do the rest of the people have to kill each other ? I do n't know , honey . We grown-ups have n't as much sense as you children . This is n't money enough , but it 's all I can spare . I 'll give you a letter to him . He may help you . I do n't know . Thank you , sir .

Oh , you switch around , eh ? Well , Daddy said you tried to help us , so I make you my second daddy . Nothing so nice ever happened to me . We got ta hurry , missy . Good-bye , Yankee . Good-bye , rebel darling .

It 'll be $9.60 for you , first class . Thank you , sir . - Have you got enough ? - No , child . It 's gon na take more money than what we got . How do people get money ?

Thank you kindly , sir . Tell me about it . My daddy went away to the war ... and then the Yankees came around to our house ... and sometimes my daddy came home . - Was he in uniform ? - Yes , sir . - What color ? - Gray . I see . Thank you , sir . Then there were so many Yankees around ... my daddy could n't come home anymore . Then they burnt down our house , and my mommy got sick ... and had to go to bed in Uncle Billy 's cabin . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . We had nothing to get her medicine with , Mr .

That 's all . So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home . The next day , my mommy went away . There , there . Do n't cry . You 're a great big girl . You must n't cry . - I won't . - What happened next ? Then the Yankees came , and my daddy had to hide in the garret . Then Colonel Morrison came in . He talked to me . He 's awfully nice . He has a little girl , too , just my age . Then he found Daddy , and Daddy told him ... about wanting to take me to my Aunt Caroline in Richmond ... so I could get enough to eat . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could bring Miss Virgie where she could be taken care of . I see . Now , on this trip ... before your daddy was captured ... did he write down anything on paper or anything ? - No , sir . - Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers ... or count them or look at the cannons ? No , sir . He told me that if we got to Richmond ... and anyone asked me what I had seen ... I was in honor bound not to tell them . - He told you that ? - Yes , sir . Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything ... and my daddy gave his word , and they shook hands . - John . - Yes , Mr . President ? - Mr . President ? - Yes , Miss Virgie . You wo n't let them shoot my daddy and Colonel Morrison , will you ? - Rush this by special courier to General Grant . - Yes , Mr . President . - Is this yours ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece .

You 're playing with dynamite when you start monkeying with those fellows . I could n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George , do n't let him start anything . He might make a bad situation worse . Now , you know your father . Tomorrow we 'll all be on the boat sailing for America . He 'll have plenty of time to cool off . Very odd circumstance . I do n't think there 's anything odd about it , [Charlie] . It 's just unfortunate that your friend met with this accident . Had cable from Major Kent asking me to investigate gambling ring . Accident seem most convenient . [Charlie] , you 've a very suspicious mind . Suspicion often father of truth . Well , at any rate , it 's in your lap . The Oceanic will be docking in a few minutes . You better go down there , see what you can find out . - Sorry about your friend , [Charlie] . - Thank you so much . [Woman_Singing] [Knocking] - Who is it ? - Steward , sir . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] - Were you going ashore , sir ? - No . You 've been cooped up here for 10 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll tone you up . - I 'm all right . Maybe you 'd like to see the doctor , sir ? I 'll get him for you . I do n't want a doctor . If I do , I 'll send for him . Right you are , sir . Marks of violence quite evident , Doctor ? The hoof prints are deeply indented in the skull . The body is still aboard , if you wish to examine it . - All in proper time . - [Ship_Whistle_Blows] So sorry . Not necessary for ladies to remain . You and Alice go to the cabin , hmm ? I 'll join you later . Please , ca n't we get this over with ? - You , uh , major 's secretary ? - I was . Yes . I 'm with Mr . [Chester] now . [Chuckles] Excuse , please . Uh , sometime memory very bad . Who you say find body ? I said it was Mr . Fenton 's stable boy . Thank you so much . You also have horse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of horses I bought in Australia . You intend racing same ? Yes , but I do n't see what that has to do with it . You say you talk with major ten minutes before death ? - Your memory 's improving , Mr . Chan . - Thank you so much . Ca n't we end this ? Dr . Johnson has made a thorough examination and said it was an accident . This unnecessary questioning is idiotic . Easy to criticize , more difficult to be correct . Will now inspect stall where major meet death . - Permission , please ? - Certainly , Mr . Chan . [Horse_Blusters] Very strange . Avalanche know major four years ... yet kick him to death . - Well , he has a bad temper . - Huh . Friendly now . You wanted to see my stable boy , did n't you ? - Please . - [Horse_Whinnies] Streamline . Streamline ! - Streamline ? - [Monkey_Chatters] Hey , you old Lollipop ! What you all doin ' ? Streamline ! Where are you ? Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Yes , sir . Quit that . What 's the matter with you ? [Monkey_Chatters] Now you all stay up there where you belong and mascot with Gallant Lad . - Yes , sir ? - This gentleman wants to ask you about the accident . He 's a detective . Is you a cop ? My , oh , my ! You remember position of body in stall ? That 's just what I 'm trying to forget . This is stall where honorable major meet death ? Oh , no , sir . It happened over yonder . Yes , after the accident , we moved Avalanche to another stall . Please . Where is Mr . Streamline ? [Groans] Yes , sir ? Here I is . Where was body ? Body ? Back yonder aging the wall lying on his face . Uh , will , uh , kindly take same position on floor ? I was just-Who ? Me ? No , do as he says now . Would greatly appreciate cooperation . Me on floor ? Could I fix him up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Do as he tells you ! - Yes , sir . Somethin ' gon na happen to me , I know . Ai n't no good come from playing dead on the floor . Thank you so much . Please to stay . Yes , sir . Horse in stall always face forward like others ? Yes . Narrow width make impossible to turn around ? That 's rather obvious , is n't it ? Then , Avalanche could only kick backward . That 's the way a horse always kicks . Thank you . - Something very strange here . - You mean me ? Now , what 's strange , Mr . Chan ? Animal kick backward , body lie there ... yet bloodstains found here . Observe , please . Shape like exclamation marks lying down ... with pointed ends toward rear of stall . Is there anything unusual about that ? Yes , very poor attempt at deception . - May borrow fountain pen ? - Certainly . Thank you . [Chatters] - [Chattering_Continues] - [Avalanche_Whinnies] Will now demonstrate only manner in which bloodstains could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what does that get you , Mr . Chan ? Idea that maybe someone stand here ... and while major pet Avalanche ... murderer crush skull with heavy weapon ... then drag body to back of stall to put blame on noble animal . This is fantastic and absurd ! There was blood on the horse 's hoofs and my examination indicated the man was- [Screeching] Why , that 's Avalanche ! [Screeching_Continues] - [Whinnies] - It 's that confounded monkey ! Get him off there ! Streamline ! Yes , sir ! Get that monkey down from there before I throw him overboard ! Come here , you Lollipop . [Horse_Whinnies] Do n't you all know better than to pester with Avalanche ? - Have n't I told you to keep that monkey away from Avalanche ? - It 's all right . I 'll give instructions that he be kept tied up for the rest of the voyage . I 'm sorry about this interruption , Mr . Chan ... but you see , Lollipop was brought up with Gallant Lad . And when I bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Perhaps he senses our rivalry , George . There 's your answer . That 's what happened . Major Kent was in the stall , and the monkey frightened Avalanche ... and he kicked the major to death before he could get out . Very excellent analysis . Why , the whole thing is preposterous ! I ca n't have my ship held here for investigation . That runs into thousands of dollars . [Charlie] is usually right when he has a hunch . Have more than hunch . - Now , look here , Mr . Chan-- Excuse , please . Took liberty of borrowing small piece from boat . - [Clanks] - Well , what 's that ? Why , it 's a part of the clutch control of the winch ! Yes , uh , twin to one missing from cargo deck outside horse stalls . Observe . Shape identical with horseshoe blows which crush skull of Major Kent . Very excellent proof of murder . That means the investigation will have to continue , [Captain] . But ca n't Mr . Chan go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , [Charlie] ? Do you want a sea voyage ? - Sea voyage good for health . - [Chuckles] Boat sail at 6:00 ? Your cabin 'll be ready . I 'll pack our bags before you can say , " Jack Robinson , " Pop . Uh , correction , please . You pack my bag . - You stay home with Jack Robinson . - Aw , gee , Pop . [Chuckles] Aloha and good luck . Thank you so much . See you later . - [Band] - [Chattering] Here you are , Mr . Chan . 212 . B Deck . - Thank you so much . - Yes , Father . Hello , Mr . Chan . Well , Mr . Chan , we 've been looking for you . I 'm afraid we treated you rather badly this afternoon . I - I owe you an apology , sir . All forgotten- like last year 's bird 's nest . [Chuckles] Does it occur to you the guilty person may have left ship ? Uh , check on passengers at gangplank reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person we bump into may be the murderer ... - sort of gives a fellow the creeps . - [Chuckles] What 'll be your next move , Mr . Chan ? Make effort to catch murderer . - For you , sir . - Well . Will you pardon me ? Listen to this ! " Do n't enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap . A dead horse ca n't win a race . " - May I see that ? - Where 'd you get this , [Bruce] ? What ? Oh , at the- at the desk . Time of delivery stamped on back of envelope ? Yes , it seems to be blurred . Four minutes past 6:00 . That 's only 10 minutes ago . - Uh , may examine , please ? - First they get the major . Now they 're trying to scare me . Look here , George . Whoever wrote this means business ... and Avalanche is too fine a horse to lose through your stubbornness . I 'll give you 20,000 for him and retire him for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the major was right . I 'm going to see it through to the finish . I 'll talk to [Captain] Blake and insist on an extra guard below . Most excellent precaution . Oh . So sorry . May have letter , please ? - Certainly . - Thank you so much . [Ship's_Whistle_Blows] Oh , gee , Pop . How 'd you know it was me ? Frequent spanking when young make rear view very familiar . Why you here ? Well , after you left , Mom decided to take the kids to visit Aunt Ling ... at the other end of the island , and I thought-Uh , you make suggestion about visit ? I - I sort of mentioned it . But , uh-Cabin boy outfit- disguise ? Oh , no , Pop . This is on the level . I signed for the trip . Now look , Pop , if a gambling ring 's back of this , it 's dangerous ... and , well , gee , I 'd feel terrible if anything happened to you ... and I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is poor who have worthy son . " Thank you so much . Then you 'll let me help ? Examine , please . [Whistles] Say ! The top edge is uneven , like it had been cut off with scissors . Yes . Writer take precaution to eliminate Oceanic trademark ... but forget watermark in paper . They 're the same , all right . Then whoever wrote this is on the boat . And look , Pop . The E 's are clogged up , and the R 's a little above the line . That means if we can find the machine this was written on , we 'll have our man . Why , it 's a cinch ! I can search all the cabins . One moment , please . Search only in pursuit of duty as cabin boy . Must remember obligation to ship . Okay , Pop . I 'll clean every room on the boat if I have to . One thing more . As , uh , humble cabin boy , must forget , " Okay , Pop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secretary . I 'm gon na bet every dollar I have on Avalanche . - Then we 'll get married and-- [Bruce] , please . That is n't the kind of marriage I want . I 'd always hoped the man I 'd marry would stay away from racing and betting . - Why , Alice , I never thought that you-- Do n't you see , darling ? That 's the sort of thing I 've had all my life . Dad and I never had a real home . It was always just one track after another . But the thrill of racing- the gamble and then winning . And losing . We never felt sure of anything . One minute Dad would be on top of the world ... and the next , we 'd have to borrow money to pay the feed bill . [Bruce] , dear , I 'd hate to go through that with you . All right , dear . Santa Juanita will be the last time . I promise . Beg pardon , sir . The gentleman in 219 wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , darling . I 'll see you in the lounge . [Locking_Door] - [With_Accent] Oh ! So " solly . " - Hear , hear . Not so fast . - You 're a new boy , are n't you ? - New now . " Velly " soon old . Ah , smart , eh ? You do n't belong up here . - And what were you doing in that cabin ? - Finish downstair . Think " velly " smart work hard . By and by " catchee " more money . Yeah ? You 'll catch more than that if I find you up here again . Now , scat ! Scat chop-chop . Typing , Faint - What are you doing here ? - Oh ! Oh . [With_Accent] Excuse , please . Write letter to girlfriend . Hereafter , write your letters somewhere else . So " solly " you mad . Clean up now , chop-chop . So " solly . " So " solly . " So " solly . " - Oh , so " solly . " - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to stay off this deck . Oh , tell him I went bottom side , Pop . I 'm awfully sorry , sir . Did I hurt you ? [Sighs] Stoop to pick up pin . Bring good luck . Good luck to that moon-faced cabin boy . He 's a very suspicious character , he is . And as soon as I get me hands on him , into the brig he goes . Did you notice which way he went , sir ? Uh , make hasty exit to north . Right you are , sir . I 'll get him . Psst ! Pop ! I found the typewriter all right . It belongs to Mr . Fenton . See ? The letters are exactly the same . Most excellent progress . Well , I guess that 's that . All we 've got to do now is arrest him . Hasty conclusion like toy balloon- Easy blow up , easy pop . Do n't you think Fenton did it ? You find way to typing machine . Maybe someone else do same . Gee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do now , Pop ? Surprise attack often find enemy unprepared . That extra guard ought to be on duty by now . I 'll step down and check . - I wish you wouldn't . - Now , dear , will you please stop worrying ? I 've done nothing but worry , George , ever since you received that note . - I told you not to say anything about it . - I know . I know . You stay here with Warren . I 'll be gone only a few minutes . Ca n't you persuade him to sell Avalanche to you ? Try and make him do it . Any progress ? Long road sometime shortest way to end of journey . - Uh , may borrow cigarette , please ? - Yes , certainly . This was n't in my pocket when we left the dining room . It 's another one of those notes . " A dead horse is n't worth $20,000 . " What does it all mean ? It means that someone knows an awful lot about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Thank you so much . Will make immediate investigation . Did you notice the way he looked at me ? Do you think he could have put that in your pocket ? No , he was n't within a yard of me . The best place for you is in your stateroom . I 'm going down to the stalls and see George right away . [Coughs] - Left at the post ? - [Bruce] 'll be back in a minute . - Alone at last . - Now , Denny , do n't tell me I 'm the only girl you ever loved . If [Bruce] does n't marry you pretty soon , I will tell you . - What 's holding things up ? - Money . He 's so noble . He insists upon waiting ... until he can support me in the manner to which I 've been accustomed . - Very foolish young man . - You mean [Bruce] ? Foolish to seek fortune when real treasure hiding under nose . [Laughs] Will you tell him that for me ? Will be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let a pal down ... you tell [Bruce] to consult me hereafter before he bets on a horse . [Chuckles] Oh , wo n't you sit down , Mr . Chan ? Thank you so much . The same in these , and make mine Scotch . - Yes , sir . - What will you have ? - Uh , sarsaparilla . - Sarsaparilla , sir ? - Please . - Very good , sir . That 's dissipation for you . You are lucky at , uh , horse betting ? I 'll say he is . With all the odds against him ... he bet on Stardust at the Melbourne Cup . - I have good hunches sometimes . - Play hunch on Stardust ? I suppose you could call it that . Look , Mr . Chan . Just as I was coming up the stairs , this fell at my feet . " It 's dangerous to know too much about other people 's business . " - [Bruce] . - Do n't get the jitters . That sounds like the one George received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Bruce] told me about it . Well , what do you make of it , Mr . Chan ? Make conclusion you talk too much . - Well , this is for you , Mr . Barton . - Hmm ? How it came to be on my tray I do n't know . It was not there when I left the bar . Well , I got one too . - They certainly are n't playing any favorites . - [Opens_Envelope] " A smart gambler knows a dead horse ca n't win . " Very interesting . May keep , please ? Will make immediate investigation . I 'd like to do a little investigating on my own hook , if you do n't mind . Cooperation greatly appreciated . Excuse , please . Well , hello , Mr . Chan . Well , this seems to be for me . Yes . " Withdraw Avalanche from the Santa Juanita Handicap . This is your last warning . " - Your secretary and Mr . Barton also receive mysterious notes . - What ? Uh , writer seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? Why do n't you do something about it ? Rabbit run very fast , but sometime turtle win race . Well , they 're after you too . [Chester] What does it say ? Most distressing . Must give immediate attention . Excuse , please . Come back here , you ! @door_opens , Closes Gee , Pop . That steward nearly grabbed me dropping that last note to Mr . [Chester] . Congratulations for most expert delivery of mysterious letters . Did your scheme work all right ? Did you find anything ? Experiment result in most interesting discovery . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] [Man] Trouble in the forward hold ! The forwards stalls . That 's where Avalanche is . Come on , Pop . One moment , please . You remain here . - [Whinnying] - Come on . Get these horses out of here . [All_Shouting] [Shouting_Continues] [Whinnying] - What started this , [Captain] ? - I 'm sure I do n't know , but it 's under control . It 's okay . It 's a lucky thing the fire was discovered in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... - just to carry out a threat against a horse . - Contradiction , please . Person who start fire intend no harm to noble animal . How do you figure that out ? Fire made directly under automatic apparatus ... so heat will set off alarm more quickly before much damage . Their way of letting me know that they could have killed Avalanche if they 'd wanted to . - Where was the extra guard when this happened ? - He was on duty . - May , uh , question him ? - Smithers ! - Yes , sir ? - You were where when alarm sounded ? On the cargo deck , sir . You had instructions to stay in here . Why did you leave ? One of the booms was squeaking , sir , and made Avalanche nervous . When Mr . [Chester] came down , he spoke to Mr . Bagley about it ... - and he told me to fix it . - That 's right . [Captain] Smithers . You also on cargo deck ? No . After Mr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long there before alarm ? About 10 minutes , maybe 15 . I do n't know exactly . - Horses alone then ? - Streamline was here . I told him to keep an eye on them till Smithers got back . Mr . Streamline ? Yes , sir ? - Yes , sir ? - You were present when alarm sounded ? Yes , sir , but- but I was asleep , sir . You see , sir , I took me a drink of gin for the misery in my feet ... and , naturally , I go to sleep when I take a drink of gin . I ought to discharge you ! Next move may be more than warning . - Extreme precaution now necessary . - You 're absolutely right . - From now on , you sleep here , Bagley . You understand ? - That 's a good idea , I guess . - You have your gun with you ? - It 's in my room . [Chester] Well , what good is it doing there ? I thought with this going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I thought with this going on , something might happen , so I was cleaning it . It 's on my table , Streamline . Get it for me , will you ? - It ai n't loaded , is it ? - Of course not . And bring the cartridges . Yes , sir . Excuse , please . What did you find , Mr . Chan ? Ghost of matches . Here are the gun and bullets , Mr . [Chester] . If you ever take another drink on duty , you 're [Man] What happened ? - Mr . Chan ! - What happened , [Captain] ? - Get a doctor . Hurry ! - [Sailor] Yes , sir . - I 'm sorry , Mr . Chan . I do n't know what to say . Happy bullet in leg rather than heart . Thank you so much . I thought you were cleaning the gun . You said it was n't loaded . It was n't when I left my room . - Ten minutes so far . - Hmm . [Knocking] You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May enter . Hello . I hear you ran into a bullet . Contradiction , please . Bullet ran into me . [Chuckles] I 'm so sorry . Really , I am . Sympathy reason for visit ? And to return the mysterious little note that you sent me . Clever idea , Mr . Chan . My compliments . Pleasure to return compliment . Clever deduction . Good . And now that you 've admitted my ability as a detective ... why not let me in on the secret ? - Whom did you expect to catch ? - Maybe you have answer . I wish I had . I liked the old major a great deal . [Nervous_Chuckle] If I can be of any service , just , uh , give me a buzz . - Thank you so much . - [Door_Closes] Do you think he did it , Pop ? Ocean have many fish . There it goes . [Man] who set fire have 12 minutes to cover trail . That 's right . Now look , Pop ... Bagley said he was in his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done it , and so could Mr . [Chester] ... because he was there while the guard was outside . But wait a minute ! It might have been that secretary of his too . Because when I dropped his note , he was coming up from the cargo deck . You know ... I still think that Fenton 's the guy we want . I could have sworn someone was at that window . [Lee] , come back . Gee , Pop , what are you always stopping me for ? Why do n't you give me a chance to clean this case up ? Foolish rooster who stick head in lawn mower end in stew . Look at you , laid up for the rest of the trip with a bullet in your leg . I 'm not gon na let them get away with that . I 'm gon na find the guy that loaded that gun ! Oh , so it 's you , eh ? What 's he doing here , sir ? Is he annoying you ? - Very desperate character . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? [Both_Speaking_Chinese] Confine to brig , please . Eagle eye for rest of voyage bring reward . Right you are , sir . I 'll stick to him like Scotch glue . [Chinese] - [Sighs] - [Door_Closes] Thank you so much . [Ship's_Horn_Sounding] Move in there and get a close-up . A little closer , Mr . Bagley . Mind keeping his head up ? Thanks a lot . All right , hold it . - Thanks a lot , Mr . [Chester] . Thanks , Mr . Chan . - Okay . - Hello , Mr . [Chester] . - Hello , boy . How are you ? - Feeling pretty fine , sir . My leg 's almost as good as new . - Well , I 'm glad to hear it . Say , I 'm sorry you lost that race in Melbourne . I 'll bet it never would have happened if I 'd been riding him . That 's all part of the game , boy . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Eddie Brill , the boy that used to ride for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chan . - Oh , I 've heard a lot about you , Mr . Chan . So pleased . What about these threats you received on the boat , Mr . [Chester] ? Avalanche will be under guard day and night , and no one else will be allowed near him . And I promise you that he will run in the handicap , wo n't you , boy ? - All right . Take him out to the trailer , Bagley . - How about you , Mr . Fenton ? Any of those new horses you bought over there show any promise ? Yes , Gallant Lad . I plan on entering him in the handicap Saturday . Well , what do you think of his chances ? Well , until the winner crosses the finish line ... it 's anybody 's money , is n't that right , [Chester] ? - That 's what makes horse racing . - [Animal_Screeching] - [Horse_Stomping] - [Man] Get down from there ! - Whoa ! Whoa , Gallant Lad ! - [Monkey_Screeching] Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lollipop ! Where you all goin ' ? - Confound that monkey ! Streamline ! - Yes , sir ? Get that monkey down from there before he gets Avalanche crazy too . Here , Mr . Fenton . - Hurry up . Get him off of there . - Yes , sir . Behave yourself . You 're the " fickliest " fool I ever did see . Why do n't you like your friend Gallant Lad no more ? Come on . Get going . Get out of here . Something very strange . What , Pop ? Before fire , monkey dislike Avalanche . Now dislike Gallant Lad . Say , that is funny . Not if horses switched . By golly , I bet that 's it . They could get away with it too . The horses look enough alike , and they 're the same build . What you gon na do ? Go to hotel , take nap . Hiya , Bagley . I thought you were in Australia . - Yeah , I know you did . What 's the new racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That horse you just put in the trailer ai n't Avalanche . That 's Gallant Lad . - Aw , you 're crazy . - Yeah ? You can fool [Chester] . He 's half blind anyway . But I ai n't . That fire was started on the boat to cover the switch . Not so loud . What 's the idea puttin ' an unknown palooka in Avalanche 's place ? - I ca n't answer that here . - Okay , where ? Come along with me . We could n't make a dime betting on Avalanche . He 's the favorite . The best we could get is even money . Sure , and nobody 's seen Avalanche in America . On the boat , the switch is made , and now Avalanche , in disguise ... goes to the post a horse no one ever heard of . Comes in a long shot with big odds . Catch on ? We 're plastering the country with bets from coast to coast at 20-to-1 , and we 'll clean up . Boy , that 's swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aw , you 're already in . Well , boys , we 've got a lot of work to do . Lefty , take Collins and get him planted somewhere where he can hide out and get a good rest . Oh , sure . I know just the spot . - Have a drink ? - Never touch it . - Need any money ? - Well , yeah , I could use some . Took almost all I had gettin ' away from Melbourne . Well , here 's a couple of hundred for you . Thanks , Bagley . I guess I had you figured all wrong . - That 's all right . - Let 's go , Collins . So long , fellas . Good-bye , Collins . Observe anything unusual during night ? Not a thing . There 's no one around this track who does n't belong here . Avalanche is guarded so closely , no one could get within a mile of him . Innocent grass may conceal snake . Not when you go through it with a fine comb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse a workout first . Well , if I can be of any further service , Mr . Chan- [Chuckles] Grateful for all kindness , [Captain] Wade . That 's all right . 1:38 and four-fifths . Not bad . Well , he 'll have to do better than that if he 's going to beat my horse . Mr . [Chester] , they 're bringing Avalanche out now . Can I ride him ? - [Chester] I would n't take a chance , Eddie . - Aw , but I can handle him , sir . - Honest , I can . I 've been able to ride for months now . - Some other time . Whoa , Avalanche ! Whoa ! Steady , boy ! Steady ! [Man] Hold him ! Hold him ! What 's the matter with that horse ? What 's the matter with that boy ? Why does n't he pull him up ? - [Man] Look out . Look out . Be careful there . - Come on now , boy . Hold him up . They 're gettin ' him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go over there . Dad , our horse made better time than that yesterday . What do you suppose is wrong ? - I told the boy to hold him back . - What for ? [Chester] Because I do n't want to advertise what we 've got . The odds will go down . - That 's a secret . - Uh-oh . Oh . [Chuckles] Interesting contraption , is n't it , Mr . Chan ? Excuse ignorance . May inquire nature of strange device ? Oh , that 's part of the latest system for timing the races . Uh , may explain , please ? Well , there 's a lamp in here . This directs a beam of light across the track ... to that little box on the other side which contains a photoelectric cell . The moment a horse passes through this beam , the cell operates ... and a picture of the finish of the race is taken up there ... in the camera-eye booth . Is possible to see , please ? Certainly . Come right along . - Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ? I want you to meet Mr . Chan , Mr . [Charlie] Chan . - Oh , uh , glad to know you . - Thank you so much . Have you got time to explain the system , Al ? Mr . Chan is interested . Oh , sure , sure . Now to begin with , uh ... here 's the diagram of the track . At every quarter mile there 's a photoelectric cell . [Charlie] Mr . Barton already explained . - Shoot beam of light across track to time horses . - That 's right . - Say , Avalanche is just about to break . - Good . I 'll turn this on and show you how it works . Now , this light was automatically turned on when he went through the first beam . It also started the timer across the track . He 's coming to the first quarter . Now watch this light . - Twenty-three flat at the first quarter . - Avalanche is sure in form . Now , if you stand there beside the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track ... you 'll see that they point directly over the finish line ready to take a picture . This switch turns on the high-speed movie cameras ... and we 're now ready to take a picture of the finish . Here he comes . He 's over . And now the film we just took is being developed in this high-speed developer . In less than two minutes ' time , Mr . Chan ... we have taken an actual picture of the finish and sent it down to the judges ' stand . That 's all there is to it . Perfection of mechanical brain make [Charlie] Chan very humble . Thank you so much . Avalanche appears strangely excited . Excuse , please . Pop , I 've got it . I 've got it ! One moment , please . You disobey instructions to remain here in room . I was n't helping any by staying here , so-So you visit racetrack stables . Gee , Pop , how 'd you know ? Hay do not grow in hotel . [Man] who flirt with dynamite sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na let you take all the chances . Look , I got in the stable , and when the guard stepped outside for a smoke ... I took some pieces of cotton and some cleaning solution too . Reveal black dye on forehead of Gallant Lad ... and then white dye on forehead of Avalanche ? Yeah , and there 's the proof . But if they 've been switched , how did Gallant Lad ... come within one second of Avalanche 's fastest time this morning ? [Lee] There 's a screw loose somewhere . Maybe loose screw here in test tube . Did you find something , Pop ? Managed to secure foam from mouth of excited Avalanche ... after practice race this morning . Observe . Bubbles prove foam contain very powerful stimulant for heart . Today make masquerader run very fast to give appearance of champion . I 've got it , Pop . It 's [Chester] and Fenton in cahoot to cheat the public . Also possible gambling ring cahooting to cheat [Chester] and Fenton . Yeah , but Pop , what are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murderer .

The Chesterjockey backs out in the face of danger . Avalanche is now without a rider . I 'm sorry , Mr . [Chester] , but I do n't want to take the chance .

Thousands are crowding the betting booths . The odds on Avalanche are less than even money but no takers . Golden Fleece is next at 3-to-1 . Shrapnel follows at four and so on down the line . Hold Away at 10-to-1 , Moneymaker at 10-to-1 ...

That 's what makes horse racing , ladies and gentlemen . May the best horse win . OnP.A . Ladies and gentlemen , it 's almost time ... for the feature race , the Santa Juanita Handicap .

He 's set the pace , but the stamina of his horse ... is not equal to the terrific speed that Avalanche shows at the half . Golden Fleece and Avalanche are out together with Golden Fleece tiring . Avalanche is holding his own with that reserve for which he 's famous . Avalanche is forging ahead . He 's every bit the horse they promised us-a real favorite . Avalanche moves into the lead . Nothing can stop him now . It looks as if he 'll establish a track record for the distance . We could n't believe this horse Avalanche was as good as they promised , but he is . He 's better . Avalanche is now a length in front . He 's got the race in the bag . There 's no doubt about it , ladies and gentlemen . The favorite is still favored . At the three-quarter- Something 's happened ! He 's lost his stride . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one horse after another . He 's almost the real defender again . He 's passed Shrapnel . He 's passing Hold Away . He 's taking the measure of Golden Fleece . He 's still got a chance . You 've never seen a race like this before . This is the wonder horse of the age , the king of the turf . Here he comes . He 's a horse in 10 million . Avalanche is giving everything he 's got . He 's back with the leaders again . Golden Fleece falters . Avalanche is at his quarters . He 's even . They 're fighting it out neck and neck . Here they come- two magnificent animals tearing out their hearts in one last terrific struggle . There 's hardly an inch between them as they shoot down the stretch . This is a finish that 's going down in history . I 've never seen another like it . The final 50 yards . Avalanche literally hurls himself across the finish line . He 's over ! Avalanche wins ! - [Crowd_Clamoring] - He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! [Announcer] Clear the track , everybody ! Everybody off the track ! Come on , Meers . Cough it up . Who 's the ringleader ? Who 's been givin ' you orders ? - Nobody 's been giving us orders . - You 're lyin ' . Look here , I 'll talk to the D.A . We 'll make it easy on you . That would n't do any good . They 'd get me just like they got [Tip] Collins . [Tip] Collins ? That 's the guy they fished out of the ocean at Santa Monica this morning ! - [Intercom_Buzzes] - Yes ? - [Man] The police are here now , sir . - You can let them come in . I 'll take ' em down to headquarters , Mr . Lansing . - Maybe we can get more out of_'em there . - Come on . Look here , Lansing . I object to being held here like this for no apparent reason .

Chan ? - [Chuckles] Present . - Oh , Mr . Chan . - Thank you . Uh , happy to report Avalanche and jockey ... as son [Lee] would say , hunky-dory . Uh , please to sit down . Warren , did you know that up to 20 minutes before the race ... Avalanche was in your stall disguised as Gallant Lad ? What ? Why , such a thing is impossible . The switch was first made on the boat by Bagley . - Then why are we all herded up here like a lot of criminals ? - Mr . Chan will explain . Have here enlarged picture . Uh , show finish of race . Observe , please . [Charlie] Dart in shoulder of Avalanche . But where did it come from ? Who could have fired it with so many people around ? Explanation here in timing head . [Clicks] Also pleased to report ... person who fire same now in custody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it , Mr . Chan . Perhaps can help , uh , solving fresh mystery . Dart very evident here ... yet strangely absent one moment later ... when doctor examine Avalanche . All present were first to reach side of noble animal . Someone use cover of excitement to remove dart . - A polite way of telling us we 're going to be searched ? - Have objection ? Not the slightest . You wo n't find it on me , Mr . Chan . Please . Also . This is nonsense . Now wait a minute . Dad , please . We 've nothing to worry about . Here it is . - Dad ! - Someone put that in my pocket . I was n't within six feet of Avalanche . It was you . You were one of the first to reach him , because I remember-Just a minute , Fenton . I see this all very clearly now . You wanted to buy Avalanche all along . When I refused to sell , you stole him and substituted your horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to protect Avalanche . - The whole thing 's ridiculous . The whole thing is obvious . You 're the only one who would have profited by the exchange . With Avalanche running for you as a ringer at 20-to-1 , you 'd have cleaned up a fortune . I guess that settles it , Mr . Fenton . You 're under arrest . - How dare you say that about my father ! - I 'll say more than that . Your father murdered Major Kent who raised Avalanche ... because he would have seen through the switch at once . He had to be gotten out of the way , so you struck him down ... with a winch shoe to make it appear that Avalanche kicked him to death . - That 's a lie ! - Alice ! Pardon , please . How you know winch shoe kill honorable major ? - Why , everyone knew that . - Contradiction , please . Only three beside humble self knew name of death weapon . Honorable chief of police ... most honorable captain of boat ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . It 's all very amusing , but I think it 's carrying a joke a little too far . [Charlie] Cold-blooded murder no joke . You and Major Kent frequently quarreled because of your gambling losses . - Well , what of it ? - Fearing investigation of same ... would reveal self as head of gambling ring ... you kill honorable major on board ship . It is n't true ! My husband often quarreled with Dad , but he could n't have done such a thing . Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife . You very clever but make mistake . On boat in Honolulu when you receive threatening letter ... have no difficulty reading same without glasses ... because contents familiar . But glasses necessary to read very legible ... time stamp on envelope . Suspected hoax then , so get corroboration later ... when you need glasses to read fake letter ... sent by humble self . Next mistake . When Avalanche received cruel dart ... you make haste to remove same ... fearing evidence point to self . Anticipating search on sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr . Fenton . I think you 'll have a little difficulty in proving that idiotic story . Contradiction , please . Proof already in evidence . Blood of unfortunate Avalanche . Take away , please . So sorry . Mr . Chan , I have a confession to make . Have already arranged for you to make same to honorable stewards of track . - You knew ? - Too bad you did not expose plot ... when you first discover switch of horses . Temptation to cash in most unfortunate . Mr . Lansing , I will remove my stable from the track at once . I think that 's very wise . Wait for me , Dad . I just want to say good-bye to Mr . Chan . I do n't know how to thank you , Mr . Chan . You 've done so much for Dad . Uh , young man win money on race ? Enough to furnish a four-room flat , I guess . Good wife best household furniture .

[Crowd_Shouting] - Is that clear ? - Yes , it 's clear . Briefly ... the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people . [Angry_Shouting] Before you start , I want you to hear that voice . Listen to it . [Angry_Shouting_Continues] [Chattering] Bring the prisoners . Prisoners to the bar . This court is now in session . - Mr . President . - TheJudge Advocate General . The death ofJohn Wilkes Booth ... who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia ... has left us eight members ... of his criminal band . So , in the name of the government of the United States ... the crime of assassination and conspiracy ... to assassinate Abraham Lincoln ... then-president of the United States ... is charged against the following : David E . Herold ... Lewis Payne ... George A . Atzerodt ... Michael O'Laughlin ... Edward Spangler ... Samuel Arnold ... Mrs . Mary E . Surratt - - [Gasps] , Whimpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr . Mudd ? I 'm General Ewing . With your permission , I should like to act as your counsel . Thank you , General . Thank you . We 'll fight together now , as we once fought each other . With the permission of the court ... we will begin the cases in order . We will start with the charge against George A . Atzerodt . Uh -- But is n't there any kind of news you can give us about - - about Dr . Mudd ? That 's all they 're gon na tell , lady - - just what you see on the board . That 's War Department 's orders . War Department 's orders ! Ha ! Did n't know they had one ! - Shh ! - Well , the dad-blamed -- Good night , [Sam] darling . The government will now present its case against Dr . Samuel A . Mudd . Tell them I 've got to speak . I 've got ta defend myself . I-- I ca n't let them treat me the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will instruct the defendant to remain silent and respect this court . I 'm confident , Mr . Erickson ... that after observing the conduct of these trials ... Dr . Mudd 's respect for this court ... is every whit as great as my own . [Man] Frank J . Thomas will take the stand . Tell the court what you know ... of Dr . Mudd 's loyalty to the federal union . Dr . Mudd was a dyed-in-the-wool slaver . Yes , sir ! Slaver ! Dr . Mudd 's name was on the prescription which I filled . Dr . Mudd served in the Confederate Army . Dr . Mudd denied that he 'd ever seen Booth . Dr . Mudd denied everything ... until I showed him Booth 's own boot right in his own home . Dr . Mudd , when I examined him in prison , confessed to me ... that he set Booth 's broken leg and then aided him with directions ... how to reach the Potomac and Virginia . - The case is ended . - No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense you 're gon na hear whether you want it or not . - The prisoner will observe order . - Why ? Why ? What more could you do to me ? What threat have you got left ? You can hang me . You can hang us all - - the innocent as well as the guilty ! Because you - - you nine gallant officers and gentlemen - - have stripped yourselves of your pride and your honor . But I 'll not go without a fight . I 'll not go without trying to blacken your memories with the insane injustice ... you 'll carry on your souls till the day you die . ! And till the day you die , you 'll ask yourselves in your heart three questions : Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone ? Was I , a physician , in the plot ... because it was part ofJohn Wilkes Booth 's plan ... to break his leg and to need me ? Does a man , whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his child ... risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak ... on their innocent lives ? In the sight of the holy God I worship , I 'm innocent . The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner . Sergeant ! And -- And you still ca n't tell me what they 've decided ? Lady , I must have told you 40 times ... that I do n't know any more than them bulletins . He 's coming now . Oh , but , General , is n't - - is n't there any possible means ... of - - of stopping things , just for a little while anyway ? My child , I 'm using every legal means that I know of . [Key_Clattering_In_Lock] Be brave , my dear . Peggy . [Martha] . - [Sobbing] - Now , now . No , darling . Do n't do that . It wo n't be long now . We 'll all be back together again . Darling . [Sam] . Do n't you know ? - Have n't they told you ? - Told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Sam] , the verdict ... was guilty . Guilty . I do n't know . It 's ... like a nightmare -- The way you ca n't fight , you ca n't run , you ca n't do anything . [All] the time , it 's coming towards you . Oh , but , darling , we have n't given up . We 're not through , not yet . No , Peggy , no . We 're not giving up - - you and [Martha] and me . But if Daddy has to stay away a little while longer . I want you to take care of Mama . You know ? Dry her tears , try to make her happy . Tell her , too , that in - - in the bottom drawer of the rolltop desk ... there are a lot of old bills - - bills that -- Well , Daddy never got around to collecting them . Maybe they 'll get enough , though , to send you to school ... buy you some new dresses . Try not to forget Daddy , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go . We 're not giving up , not yet , dear ! Hey , bring him downstairs . My cell is here . [Chuckles] You ai n't going to need a cell anymore . - I 'll see General Hunter . I know him very well . - Oh , [Martha] . [Martha] . [Man] Shoulder . ! Halt . ! [Gasps] Oh , not now ! No , no . Not now ! Please ! No ! Steady . Steady , dear . Say , you got the best place in the yard , lady . Over yonder 's where they 're coming out . [Gasping] Courage . Courage , my dear . [Drumroll] [Drums_Stop] [Man] Right face . ! Forward march . ! [Drumroll] [Drums_Stop] Right face ! Forward march ! [Drumroll] [Sam] ! Darling ! Courage . Courage . [Stops] Well , looks like that 's all . He 's going to live ! Live ! Present arms ! [Gasps] , @cries_out [Drums_Stop] - Well , I guess the show 's over . - Phew . - What about him ? - Life imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , sir . Hard one's . Report ' em to the officer of the guards . Yes , sir . Mudd-- Number 6 . [All] right . Left step ! - Next . - William A . Dunger . William Dunger - - insubordination , striking an officer . - Ten years . - Left step ! - Next . - Otto Lehrman . Otto Lehrman - - desertion , 20 years . You 'll never make it , Otto . You 're too old . The mosquitoes will get you . Left step ! - Next . - Samuel A . Mudd . Dr . Samuel A . Mudd . Dr . Mudd , I 've been waitin ' for you . So all they gave you was life . Could n't hang you , eh ? Well , byJudas , you 're gon na wish they had fore I 'm through with you ! Take a look at him , you filthy rats ! Take a look at the man who killed Abe Lincoln ... the greatest man who ever lived . Look at him ! Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left step ! [All] right . Drop your chains . Attention . Now , before we go any further here ... I want you to listen to me ... because I know exactly what you 're thinking ... every mother 's son of ya . You 're figuring on whether you 're gon na be able to break out of here . Well , we got a little way here of putting thoughts like that ... out of your heads . Follow me . You first , Doctor . Come on . Get up ! Halt ! Now , whenever you slops get to figuring ... on breaking out of here ... I just want you to give a little thought to this moat . It runs all around the island . It 's 7 5 feet wide ... and 35 feet deep . And you know what we keep in it ? We keep pets in it . Nice little pets . We got more pets in that moat than you can count . And sometimes we feed ' em . Not often . Oh , no . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to give ' em a little treat . Now watch close . ## [Whistling] [Buck] ! Move on , white man . - A prisoner , sir . - Just a minute . Now , you know , that 's quite interesting . Those are mosquito larvae . See there . But not very interesting to anyone but a medico , I 'm afraid . Well , I 'm also a physician , sir . No . Now I am pleased . That 's Dr . Mudd . Oh . Well , I - - I thought that -- I thought that , that as another physician , you would understand the circumstances - - the obligation of a doctor to - - to give aid to anyone , whoever he might be . Mr . Mudd ... if you assumed you might find sympathy here , get rid of the idea . The profession you have dishonored is ashamed of you ... ashamed of your membership in it . As a doctor , I may tell you that I despise you even beyond the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to swear to you on the - - on the honor of the profession we both respect ... that I had nothing whatsoever to do with - - with the death of Mr . Lincoln ? It would be of no use whatever . I 'm sorry , sir . Bugle : Taps [Ends] [Buck] Marse [Sam] . ! Marse [Sam] . - Oh , [Buck] . - Marse [Sam] . I 's sorry , sir ... but I was too scared this afternoon . I could n't say nothin ' to you then . Oh , I knew . I knew that . Tell me , what are you doing down here ? - Oh , I 've been here a month waiting for you , sir . - You have ? Yes . You see , Mrs . Mudd , she told me to get on down this here man 's island . [Chuckling] So here I is - - done gone on down on it . Oh , you - - you 've given me the first hope I 've had since this - - since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But , uh , here 's some soap I brung you . - What ? Oh , yes . I guess I do need it . - Yes , sir . - But it 's for the mosquitoes . - Mosquitoes ? - Yes , sir . You put it on your face and hands . - Oh , I know . I know . Yes , sir , because there 's more mosquitoes on this here man 's island ... than I 've ever seen before . - I know . That 's why -- - Watch it . [Footsteps] My home , sir . Darling , General Ewing . How do you do , General ? This is Judge Maiben of the district superior court . Why , how do you do , Judge ? - How do you do , sir ? - The judge is a Yankee , but he 's honorable . - Thank you , [Colonel] . - He 's gon na get [Sam] out of jail . - But , Colonel-- [Colonel] , please -- - Wo n't you sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me explain , General . At my request and for my own satisfaction ... Judge Maiben 's gone over the whole record of the case word by word . On the evidence produced , no civil court could hold Dr . Mudd for 1 0 minutes . You have some sort of plan , Judge ? The plan is , uh , Mrs . Mudd 's . No judge 'd dare devise anything quite so , uh , extreme . I explained toJudge Maiben what happened ... to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for [Sam] . The government simply laughed at it . But ... if a writ was served on him in , say , Key West ... a civil municipality , it would be honored , would n't it ? Of course . But Dr . Mudd 's not in Key West . - I know he is n't ... yet . - What did I tell you ? But , great Scott , Mrs . Mudd , you surely would n't dare -- General Ewing , I 'd dare anything for my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It 's exoneration too . He 's innocent , and I want them to say so to the whole world . - But if we wait -- - Wait ? Wait for what ? For the government to kill my husband ? That 's all we 've done is wait and trust and have faith . Oh , I 'm so sick of waiting . I 've found a way to get [Sam] out . Just a moment , Mrs . Mudd . Now , all I have to say is this . If Dr . Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West ... I could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him . Now , under its protection , he could be brought back here . I 'd reopen the case , and I feel sure ... give him a far different trial than the one he had at the court-martial . But as to how Dr . Mudd ... is going to be able to get to Key West ... well , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , and remember ... I wo n't be the only Yankee who 'll be praying with you . - And do n't let anything disturb you . - I won't . - Good day , gentlemen . - Good day . We 'll sell , pawn , mortgage everything . We 'll get enough money . Oh . You understand what this means to me , do n't you ? It 's all that 's left of our lives - - [Sam] 's and [Martha] 's and mine . And it 's only your support - - your support behind us - - that we 're asking . You can leave the escape entirely to me , sir . Within 2 4 hours , I 'll have 5,000 of my old brigade under my command . We 'll seize a war vessel or two and blow the whole dad-blamed prison to ashes ... and deliver [Sam] in Key West with a guard of honor . I 'm sorry , Mrs . Mudd ... but if you 're set on such a foolhardy plan ... I must withdraw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to be free to be tried . - It 's the only way . Oh , do n't you see ? - I 'm sorry . - The risk is too great . - Igad , sir ! And if you 'll take my advice , you too will abandon this mad scheme . - What do you think ? - [Chuckles] Igad , sugar ... we 'll show these dad-blamed , chickenhearted Yankee lawyers ! [Groans] You leave it to me . I 'm gettin ' tired of this fiddling ' around , messin ' around . Lawyers ! Lawyers are no-good -- Oh . Yeah , lawyers are dad-blamed old women with their habeas corpus and all that . Lookee there . There . You see that ? StonewallJackson gave me that . Pure Toledo . And if I do n't get $1 50 for that ... I 'll have the pleasure of spitting the heart of the swine that dare offer me less . Open the door ! Marse [Sam] ! - Marse [Sam] ! - Yes , [Buck] ? Thanks . Thanks . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed my name up a little bit to make it sound kind of nice . [Buck] , I 'm ready . - But tonight , sir ? - Yes , tonight . But how about the moat and them sharks ? - I 'm gon na have to try the bridge . - But they got a guard on it . - Yeah , I know . - Watch it . - Marse [Sam] . - Yeah . - If I could go with you -- - Yes . I can arrange to be the guard that 's on the bridge . If you could arrange to be the guard on the bridge , we could both go together . - Now , listen . - Yes , sir . There 's gon na be a boat . It 's gon na flash two lights . I 'm gon na have to swim to it . [Guard] Nice view ? [Lock_Unlatching] What 's outside ? Just outside . Do n't start anything you might be sorry for , Doctor . [Cell_Door_Closes] Second guard detail , forward step ! [Guard] detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . What were you doin ' down in that cell block ? - Uh , cells which ? - I saw you . ! No , sir . T'were n't me . As you were . Left face . Forward step ! - What 's up ? - I do n't know , but I 'm gon na find out . What post is that boy [Buck] on ? - The bridge . He swapped with another one of them . - That 's what I thought . Relieve him . Place him under arrest and bring him here . - What 's up ? - Mudd 's out . Wait ! He 's out , but I do n't want him back alive . Do you understand ? Post extra guards to the bridge . Notify all sentries . We 'll see if we can give this Judas what the court-martial should 've given him . Tell them to shoot and shoot straight ! [Guard] , watch that -- No . Wait . [Guard] that magazine over there . Quick step ! [Waves_Crashing] [Man] Halt . ! Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star boarder 's out . ! - What ? - Yeah , and Rankin do n't want him back . His orders are to shoot on sight . [Man] If I see him , I will , with pleasure . Mudd 's out ! Double all your guards . Guards , halt ! Cover that cell . You cover that house there . Go and watch that gate . The rest of you , follow me . Get ! Soldier . ! You 're under arrest . - But I just -- - Keep it to yourself . Move ! Take your post . [Whispering] [Buck] ! [Buck] ! [Yells] [Buck] ! [Gunshot] ## [Call_To_Assembly] [Man] Bring out those pieces on the double . Hurry it up . ! [Bugle_Continues] [Gunfire_Continues] Give me that . Wait ! [Gunshot] There ! There he is ! [Gunfire_Continues] Keep firing ! He 'll never make it ! If we do n't get him , the sharks will . - What sharks ? - What sharks do you think , sir ? Sergeant , with that barrage on the water ... you 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of this spot . Stop firing , you fools ! You wan na drive those sharks away ? Keep your eyes open . ! [Man] I-I do n't see anything down here . Out yonder ! He 's outside ! [Gunfire_Continues] There 's a boat putting ' in toward him . Rankin , man two boats . I want that man back . Alive ! You understand ? Yes , sir . Boat crew number one ! Number two ! - [Man] your boats ! - [Man] Number one . ! [Shouting] , Indistinct [Shouting] Pull , you mangy rats ! - Starboard a little more . - There he is , boys ! Pull him in ! Pull , you lazy rats ! On your way ! You 're all right now , [Sam] . Come along . That 's a boy . [Panting] He 's all right now . He 's all right . Now , get him right over here in this bunk . It 's all right . There you are , [Sam] . That 's a boy . - Oh , darling , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Do n't get him excited . Good . - Oh , my darling , you 're wounded . - He 's all right now . - You 're an angel , Peggy . - Everything 's arranged for . You 're gon na have a new trial . And [Martha] 's waiting . - Where 's [Martha] ? - In Key West . She has n't ... forgotten me ? Oh , my sweet , not for one little minute . [Gunfire] Igad , I 'll soon stop this ! - You stay here with [Sam] . - Dad ! Dad ! - No ! - [Gunshot] Oh , they ca n't take you back . They ca n't ! [Sobs] Hiya , Judas . [Sobbing] [Woman] And then the prince leaned down ... and kissed the sleeping beauty on both eyes - - smack , smack . - And what do you suppose happened ? - [Martha] What ? - [Woman] The sleeping beauty waked up . - Mama . ! Where 's Daddy ? Daddy ... could n't come , darling . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean forever . He 'll come yet . He will , I promise you . Where 's Grandpa ? Grandpa 's gone away . He 's gone a long , long way away . Forever ? Forever . [Sobs] How long has it been , Marse [Sam] ? I do n't know . Three , maybe - - maybe four days , I guess . Marse [Sam] ... can I have a little bit more of that water ? I ai n't even heard no bugle calls . Ai n't even seen nobody . No food , no nothin ' . I guess everybody just done run on off and left us . Reckon it 'd do any good to holler again ? No , I hollered till I 'm hoarse . What you suppose happened ? I do n't know , [Buck] . Maybe - - Maybe just as you say -- That they have gone off and left us to die maybe . Tell the captain of that ship I 've got to have those supplies . Tell him I got a thousand hospital cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry , but I refuse to put in . Tell him he 's a filthy yellow coward with my compliments . Tell him I 've waited five bloody days ... for him to make up his lily-livered soul to be a man and deliver me my medicine . And now , if I do n't see some action out there inside of five minutes ... I 'm gon na turn a cannon on his bloody tub and blow it to kingdom come ... government ship or no government ship ! That 'll make you sleep a little . You 're gon na be all right , son . [Sighs] Good morning , Clark . Are you all right , sir ? Just tired . Very tired . It 's a hard job , son . Always a hard job when you do n't know what to do ... and got no one to do it with you .

If ever I get my hands on that muck 's throat -- Imagine the hound , loading my supplies on rafts ... and just shoving ' ' em toward the shore through that surf . Look at ' em ! Scared to land ' em . Scared to touch ' em . Scared to tend ' em when they 're sick . Holy mother ! How long do they expect to live ? Forever ? Beg pardon , sir . If the commandant pleases , there 's a doctor among the prisoners . - Dr . Mudd . - Mudd ? - Yes , sir . - Dr . Mudd ? Come on . Open up . Doctor , I 'm here on a curious mission . I want your help . - My help ? - I need it desperately . Doctor , this island is a pesthole . It 's teeming with yellow fever . The worst epidemic we 've had in years . I 've got 3,000 men here - - soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or crazy with terror ... and we 're all trapped here together . What 's all this to me ? That 's what you must decide for yourself , sir . And the good Dr . MacIntyre ? The good Dr . MacIntyre is down bad . You 're quite right . You could n't possibly be in a better position ... to tell me and my men to go straight to the devil . And no one would understand it better than I would . In your place , I 'd do it myself . But in spite of that and in spite of the fact ... that I can promise you no reward ... that I can offer you nothing but exposure to death ... I want your help . Once before , I was a doctor . I 'm still a doctor . Thank you , Dr . Mudd . [Buck] . [Buck] . We 're - - We 're going up in the open . Will you give me a hand , sir , please ? It was the last straw when they heard about Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the mess hall now barricaded , guards and all . We 've got to do something , sir .

He 's very sensitive . - Yours ? - Looks like me . - Who 's the musician in the family ? - My brother , Ned . I saw him this morning when I arrived . At least I saw somebody with a hangover . That was Ned . He could have been a fine musician . - What do you mean ? - lf Father had n't interfered . - Who performed on the flying trapeze ? - All of us .

She 's beautiful and exciting , too , do n't you think ? Stop it . I 'll start jittering . It 's terribly important that she should marry the right person . - That 's important for everyone . - No . It 's particularly so for Julia . I suppose you realize you 're a rather strange bird in these parts ? How 's that ? You do n't know the men we see as a rule . Where 've you been ? Working hard . - Nights ? - Nights , too . What about these little jaunts to Placid ? Come clean , Case . Want to know something ? That was the first holiday I ever had . - No . - Sure . - Then you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was 10 . - Ten ? - Sure . At what ? Anything I could get . Financial house the last few years .

What did you try after you discovered you could n't paint ? - Case , are you drawing me out ? - Sure . Come on . - You really want to know ? - Sure . Well , I tried to go on the stage . Would you care to see me do the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth ? - " Out , damned spot ! " - No , some other time . The teachers at Miss Porter 's School thought it was very promising . - What else ? - There were lots of humorous episodes . I tried to get Father to let me take a nursing course at a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help some strikers over in Jersey . How was I to know that Father was on the board of directors of the company ? You see , Case , the trouble with me is that I never could decide whether I wanted to be Joan of Arc , Florence Nightingale or John L . Lewis . - What 's the matter , you fed up ? - To the neck . Even with this million-dollar museum ? All those marble pillars down there ? Case , compared to the life I lead the last man in a chain gang thoroughly enjoys himself . What you need 's some time off from what you 've been doing day in , day out . You mean from what I 've not been doing days in , please , years out . How does your garden grow , Case ? Is life wonderful where you are ? It can be . - But it has n't been ? - I do n't call what I 've been doing " living . " - What do you recommend for yourself ? - A holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I need . - You mean just to play ? - No , I 've been working since I was 10 . I want to find out why I 'm working . The answer ca n't be just to pay bills or pile up more money . Even if you do , the government takes most of it . - But what is the answer ? - That 's what I intend to find out . The world is changing out there . There 's new exciting ideas running around . Some right , some cock-eyed , but they are affecting our lives . I want to know how I stand , where I fit in , what all this will mean to me . I ca n't find that out sitting behind a desk in an office . I 'm going to get money together , and then knock off . - Quit ? - Quit . I want to save part of my life for myself . There 's a catch to it though , it 's got to be part of the young part . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work when I know what I 'm working for . - Does that make sense to you ? - That makes a lot of sense . - Does Julia know ? - No . I wo n't get her hopes up until I get enough money . She has enough for two right now , or for 10 , for that matter . I do n't want her dough . I 've got to earn it myself . That 's foolish . You 're all right , though . You have n't been bitten or caught by it yet . - By what ? - The reverence for riches . - Look out for that , Johnny . - No , not for me . - Who took the Scotch from my closet ? - What happened in church ? - It was in my riding boots , a full quart . - Neddie , shut up .

Johnny and I can bear it . Ca n't we ? You really want to hear it ? Neddie , no . I 've been boasting about you . Hello . What are you all doing up here ?

You would n't expect it of a man in Father 's position , but money is our God here . - Johnny , it is n't true at all . - No ? What is , then ? Well , young man ? Well , sir , at the moment I have in my pocket exactly $34 and a coupon for a Bank Night at a Lake Placid movie . No gilt-edge securities , no rolling woodlands ?

It 'll be the same old story , of course . - I 'm being married for my money . - That 's always flattering , is n't it ? What 's the use of all we 've got unless to get us a superior type of man ? Linda , I hate you to talk like that . But , Julia , seriously he 's like spring . He 's like a breath of fresh air . Do you know what he called this place ? A museum . Julia , here 's your chance .

And just a few people . Just your friends and Johnny 's and up in the old playroom . Let me plan it . Let me give it . Let me do something for you once . Me , Julia .

Do n't let him bully you . - Good morning . - Good morning , Father . - Did you see Mr . Hobson , Father ? - Just for a moment . There 's another thing to be considered . What is the young man 's background ? What did Mr . Hobson say ? But we must n't rush into things , must we ? I want to be married on January 10 . That 's two weeks from this Tuesday . Impossible . - Why ? - Yes , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy has loads of charm , Father . - You know him ? - I 've heard tell of him . Charm . I suppose it 's solid merit you 're after .

Which reminds me , I 'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00 . - 6:00 ? What for ? - As an example to the other men . - But there 's nothing for me to do after 3:00 . - You 'll find something . See here , Father , if you think I 'm going to fake -- Did you understand me , Ned ? Father , what did Mr . Hobson say ? It was n't the time or place to go into the matter with him . I asked him to drop by tonight . Father , but what did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a blow . - He appears to have some business ability . He has put through a successful reorganization of Seaboard Utilities . - Seaboard ? Poor fellow . - Shrewd fellow , perhaps . Hobson says the signs are not unfavourable for Seaboard . We 'll buy some in the morning , Ned . But we must know more about Mr . Chase 's background . Case , Father . Let it go . Chase has such a sweet banking sound . - Father , he 's from Baltimore . - Fine , old , pre-war stock , I imagine . Was n't there a Judge Case somewhere ? I intend to know more about the young man than his name and his place of birth . It would be advisable that when he arrives he finds me alone in order that I may conduct the inquiry along my own lines . I wo n't allow the subject of an engagement to come up in my first talk with him . Would n't you like me to hide under the sofa and take shorthand notes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the poor guy ought to see one friendly face in the courtroom . Yes , Henry ? - Mr .

No doubt the fellow is an impostor . - Father . - Yes , Julia ? Remember , I know what I want . Come in . I hope I 'm not late . I got caught in traffic . Father , this is Mr . Case . - How do you do ? - How do you do , sir ? My daughter Linda . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? And my son , Edward . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Ned , if you and your sisters will do the telephoning you spoke about I shall try and entertain Mr . Case . We 'll be back in a few minutes , Johnny . What would we do without the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Linda ? Me , Father ? I ca n't remember a thing . We seem to be enjoying quite an unusual freedom from snow this winter . I like snow . That 's why I went up to Lake Placid . Placid ? Yes , my daughter Julia has just come from there . Yes , I know . - You 're in business in New York , Mr . Case ? - Yes , sir . I 'm with Sloan and Hobson . An excellent firm . - A born New Yorker ? - No , no . I was born in Baltimore . July 6 , 1908 . I 'm 30 . I used to have a lot of good friends in Baltimore . Let me see . The Whites , the Clarence Whites . - Possibly you knew them ? - I do n't believe I ever did . - No ? And there was Archer Fuller 's family . - I 'm afraid not . Let me see , Colonel Evans , old Philip Evans . No . I have n't been there in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . You see , my father had a small grocery store in Baltimore . Yes . He never made a go of it though and when he died he left several debts which Mother worked hard to clear up . I was just a child at the time and I could n't help her very much . Mother died the May before my 16th birthday . How sad . Yes , it was pretty sad . I had n't any connections except for an uncle who 's in the roofing business in Wilmington . He was n't much good , though . He was inclined to get drunk . Still is . We have an uncle like that but he keeps off roofs . Mother had wanted me to go to a big Eastern college so I worked my way through Harvard . In vacations , I worked in a steel mill and in an automobile factory . One summer I drove a garbage truck .

Why , this is a complete surprise to me . I hardly know what to say to you . - Well , " yes " would be pleasant . - I 'm sure it would . However , we must go into the matter a little more carefully , I 'm afraid . The only difficulty about that is the time . Julia 's idea is January 10 . Mine , too . We 'll see about that .

I 'm decent and civilized and I love your daughter , which is n't hard . She seems to like me , too , and that 's about all that can be said for me except that we have a grand chance of being happy . - So do I . - Come on , Father , be an angel . The matter is too important to be decided offhand . You 'll be married when I 've come to a decision and on a day which I will name . - Our plan was the 10th . - That is out of the question . - Yes , Henry ? - Luncheon , sir . - Mr . Seton , l -- - Luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Thank you . I have a haberdasher who 's made my ties for a good many years and that particular pattern I seem to recognize . Possibly , sir , because this happens to be your necktie . Ned and I thought it might bring me luck . Father . Come in , Julia . I thought you might like some hot chocolate . Thank you . I just saw Mr . Hobson leave . - Did you and he have a nice talk ? - Yes . Father what have you decided ? Marriage is an extremely important step for a young girl . Mother was younger than I when she married you . In marrying me , your mother and her family took no risk , either financially or , if I may say so , spiritually . - Johnny will do well financially . - No doubt about it . - Hobson tells me he has great possibilities . - I know it . Then it 's all right ? - Do you see that cigar ? - Yes , Father . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your grandfather smoked the same brand . I know the quality of tobacco in it because I own the plantation where it was grown and I know therefore that when I light it , it will burn smoothly and pleasantly . And I know above everything else that it will never explode in my face . And you 're afraid that Johnny might ? There 's a strange new spirit at work in the world today a spirit of revolt . I do n't understand it and I do n't like it . Do n't worry about Johnny . I know him better than you . My dear , I 've never denied you anything that was in my power to give . He 'll burn , Father , calmly , steadily , pleasantly . It 's only of you and your happiness I 'm thinking . Father you can trust me . I 'll take care of myself . Thank you , Father . - Can we announce it New Year 's Eve ? - I shall arrange a party . How wonderful ! Linda had said something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of hers . I think by now you and I know how to take care of those ideas of Linda's . - It was awfully sweet of her . - Linda has many generous impulses . Father ? Come in , Linda . Is it yes ? Father , I knew you 'd do it . - Be careful , you 'll put my cigar out . - What 's a cigar on a night like this ? Darling , I 'm so glad . Have you told Johnny ? - I have n't had time . - Telephone him right away . Well , then let 's ring bells . Let 's send up skyrockets . Let 's turn on all the lights in the house . Father , are n't you proud of yourself ? Gee , this would have made Mother happy . Mother , you 'd love him . Do n't forget I 'm to give the party to announce the engagement . I 've got it all planned . Just a few people , Johnny 's friends and Julia 's and up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no engraved invitations . I like your tie , too . - By the way , where 's Linda ? - She 'll be down soon . I 'm sure she will . - She just hates big parties . - But not this one ? Johnny , look at Father . He 's just seething with excitement . You 've won his heart completely . - He 's been awfully nice to me . - Father 's such a dear . He made all the arrangements for the party himself . Is that the fellow ? He 's rather good-looking at least . - Hello , Uncle Edward . - Good evening . - Seton . - Good evening , Uncle Edward . There 's Laura and Seton Cram . He 's my cousin . Darling , tell me , when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia ? Shortly after midnight as a surprise . Well , Julia seems divinely happy . What does Linda say ? You know , we have n't seen Linda all evening . Linda has been somewhat indisposed . If asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Linda 's headaches . Now , do n't worry , darling , we understand perfectly . She shall come down before the announcement . Of course . Now do n't worry , darling , you just leave everything to us , will you ? It 's a lovely party . Now what 's the matter with Linda ? Hello , Dorothy , you look lovely . - Dear , where 'd she get that horrible dress ? - Uncle Edward is worried , is n't he ? - Hello , Bunny . - Hello , Seton . I 'd be worried , too , if I had children like Ned and Linda . Now he takes an utter stranger into the family . I do n't approve of it at all . If Linda had done it I could understand , but for Julia to take an unknown climber ... . Mother 's furious about it . He 's obviously after Julia 's money . Hello , Countess . He does n't even belong to the Harvard Club . Julia , darling , you look lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Hello , Seton . - I 'm Cousin Laura and I 'm so happy about it . My dear , he is attractive , is n't he ? This is my husband , Seton Cram . He 's Julia 's cousin . - I married into the family . - Not a bad family to marry into . Congratulations . - Thank you , Mr . Cram . - Do n't " Mister " him . We grew up together . We 've heard such wonderful things about you . - Have you ? From whom ? - Well , from everybody . My dear , it 's such a shame about Linda . She does have such frightful luck with those headaches of hers , does n't she ? Yes . There 's Ned . We 've been looking for him . Come on . We 'll see you later . - Good-bye , Johnny . - See you later , Johnny . Ned , did you speak to Linda ? How do you like Seton and Laura ? It 's a privilege to meet them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheer up , Johnny . If you find Seton and Laura dull , wait until you meet some of the others . The more you find out about us Setons , the more impressive we become . Father wanted a big family , you know . Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him . Linda was a girl , so she promptly had Julia . Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless . The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land . It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish . It must have been a consolation to Father . He must have been very grateful to Mother . Drink to Mother , Johnny . She tried to be a Seton for a while , then gave up and died . You 're talking through your hat , Ned . But , I 'm not . Ned , what did Linda say ? - She 's coming down , is n't she ? - Do n't make me laugh , Sister . - What 's all this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . It 's nothing . Just one of Linda 's whims . The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party . Between you and Father you 've changed her shindig into a first-class funeral . She should 've realized Father could n't announce my engagement without a fuss . She should have , yes , but unlike me , Linda always hopes . Bottoms up to Linda . Ned , please , you 've been drinking steadily since 8:00 . Yes , funny old Ned . On New Year 's Eve , too . Johnny , try to stop him . I shall drink as much as I like at any party I agree to attend . And as much as I like is as much as I can hold . It 's my protection against your tiresome friends . Linda 's out of luck . She has n't any protection . Robert , another highball , please . Ned , take it easy . Aye , aye , sir . - The name , sir ? - The name is Professor Nicholas Potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' cloakroom is the second door to the left , madam . Thank you . - Hello , Mr . Thayer . - Well . - It 's getting near the New Year . - That 's right , sir . - It lacks about an hour , I should say . - An hour and 38 minutes , Edgar . Thank you , sir . - The elevator is to the rear and right . - Would it be too much -- Hello , Mr . Jennings . - Coming close to the New Year now . - One hour and 27 minutes , Edgar . - He 's fast . - Yes , sir . The elevator is to the rear and right . - Thank you , but you have my shoe . - I beg your pardon . It 's quite all right . A very natural mistake , as a matter of fact . Thank you . I 'll do it . Do n't tell anyone , but I 've got a run in my stocking . Good heavens , we 're ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No , sir . The elevator ... . Is to the rear and to the right . I 'm sorry . - Perhaps we 'd better use the elevator . - To the rear and to the right . I think we 'd better go home . Courage , dear , courage . Remember , we promised Johnny that we 'd come . This reminds me a little of the palace of the Emperor Caligula . - You remember Caligula , do n't you ? - Very well , indeed . Whatever became of him ? - To the rear ... . - And to the right . Now where ? Seems to have been some sort of a residence at one time . It 's the Gashouse Gang , darling . The party 's downstairs . Thank you . Sorry to intrude . No . Wait a minute . - You 're Susan Elliott ? - Yes . My married name is Potter . No , but you lectured once at our school . I 'm Linda Seton . - You 're not . - Yes . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister . - You know Johnny ? - For years . I 'm so glad to see you . Come in . - Who 's that ? - That is my husband , Nick Potter . You can come in , too . Close the door . Who lives here ? I live here . I live here , in a manner of speaking . I see . You would n't eat your oatmeal this morning , so they wo n't let you go to the party ? I 'm the mad sister , the family problem . The one they do n't speak about . - Yes , so was I . - You see what happened to her . - What ? - She had to marry me . A professor without a cent of money . So you 'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge . - Sit down , will you ? - Thank you . - My , it 's good to be home again . - Yes , we 've had quite a long walk . - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to give a party tonight . I had it all planned . I was going to ... . Well , it was a good idea . It might have been fun . - Your sister , Julia . - Is she anything like you ? Do n't worry , she 's not at all like me . - Have n't you met her yet ? - No . You must . Johnny 'll be glad to see you . - But you must . It 'll spoil Johnny 's party . - Definitely no . Definitely no . My brother , Ned . I thought you might want a little cheering up . Ned , how sweet of you , how really sweet . I 'm a sweet kid . Take this back to the orchestra leader , please . My brother , Ned , Mr . and Mrs . Potter . Friends of Johnny 's . He used to live with us . We 've come to warn his future bride . He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste . Then we 'll drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? No , I 'm wrong . He does n't need it . Johnny 's doing all right . - What 's on your mind , Ned ? - Nothing 's on my mind . What do you mean , " Johnny 's doing all right ? " I mean he 's doing all right . He 's having a whirl . His hair 's slicked down and Father 's seeing that he meets the important people . My word , are there important people downstairs ? Frightfully important . That 's why I wanted to give a party up here . Miss Seton on New Year 's Eve entertained a group of very unimportant people . To our hostess . May I drink , too ? Believe it or not , I 've just been learning how much it costs to keep up a yacht . - What 's the matter ? - Father sent for me . It 's about Linda . Everybody has begun to talk about her not being here . - She 's simply got to come down . - Got to ? Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I 'll ask her . - Insist on it . I 'll do what a gentleman can do under the circumstances . - That 's good . Was that good ? - No ! Yeah , marvellous . - Unless I 'm getting drunk . - No . It 's the first champagne I 've had since I was 4 . Not really ? - Do you mind if I play with your toys ? - I think you 'd better . - Thank you . - That 's all right . He 's grand . - Has Johnny any other friends like him ? - There are n't many people like Nick . Or like Johnny either , for that matter . - We 've had wonderful times , we three . - You 'll have a lot more fun with Julia . You must let Ned and me be guest members of the Johnny , Julia , Nick and Susan Club . Look what I 've found . Come on , let 's do Romeo and Juliet . " What light through yonder window breaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . - Did you ? - This is a lovely one . - Do one for us . Go ahead . Come on , Neddie . It 's all complete , including the characters . You remember any of the lines ? Linda . Johnny , come in . - I have a message for you . - And I have a message for you . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested downstairs . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested right here . - There 's a meeting of the club . - Your club . No . Come on , the party needs you . Now 's the time to come to the aid of the party . But your father is really upset . Why , you do n't tell me . What seems to be the matter ? Everybody has begun to notice you 're not there and it 's embarrassing the family . The ... . Johnny -- Linda , be a good sport now . It will make your father awfully happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on my hands and knees ? That 's telling him . Oh , my . - That 's not Johnny . - No ? - Who is it ? - That 's a very important person . Hello , important person . Do n't be fresh . - Treat important persons with respect . - I won't . - Hello , important person . - Yeah ? Take your place . What is this ? It 's the voice of experience . Nick and Susan ! Sir , that lady is my wife . Nick , thank goodness you came . The face is familiar . But ... . Do we know anyone who smells of violet ? - How 's that , you dog . - No . It ca n't be . It 's Johnny Case . You remember him . John Case , the rail-splitter , friend of the people . Yes . - Well , we 're glad to have you back . - Back ? You mean the marble pillars got me . I 'm ready . I 'll go quietly . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got that off my mind . - Never forget it . There 's something I want you to know . - That deal I mentioned ? - The Seaboard thing ? - I think it 'll go through . - You do n't mean it ? There 's a very fair chance that I 'll be able to quit business next Saturday . So that you can go on the holiday ? Sure , Johnny 's Declaration of Independence . It 's all according to what a Boston crowd called Bay State Power does . - Maybe they 've done it already . - They 'll do it ! - Then let 's drink to Bay State Power . - No , let 's drink to Julia . - Have you met her yet ? - No . If she 's anything like her sister ... . No , we 'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay State Power , love and happiness and ... . Here you are . For the love of Pete , it 's The Witch and Dopey . I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? We like it . Linda , are you aware that there 's another party going on in this house ? You mean that low-class dancehall downstairs ? Do n't speak of it . Excuse me , these are my friends . Professor and Mrs . Potter , Mr . and Mrs . Cram . How do you do ? You old fox , you . Fox ? Sam Hobson 's been telling me about your little haul in Seaboard . You might have let us in the family in on it . - There 's still time . - Not the way that stock 's acting . We have an order to buy 60,000 shares for Ross of Bay State Power all the way up to 30 . - Are you sure of that ? - I took the order myself . That cinches it . - Is that it ? - Just about . Good for you . Come on ! Good for you . Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday . I think I could help you double your yield . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're probably joking , Professor . With the help of the right people in Wall Street you 'll make more within two years . It would n't take that long if we had the right kind of government . - Like which country for example , Mr . Cram ? - Now no political arguments . - Let 's go downstairs and celebrate . - Yes , this is a wonderful party . - I 'm not going downstairs . - Come on , do n't be foolish . - But , Linda , your father said -- - I thought so but I 'm not going downstairs . - Of course if -- - I would n't keep anyone who wants to . If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I 've seen . And has someone asked you ? Come , dear , we can discuss this later . You would n't care to swing on the trapeze and discuss it now , would you , Seton ? We shall see you later , Mrs . Porter . Professor Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong . In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . And present you , my dear boy , with this token of their affection and esteem . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Mr . Toastmaster , ladies and gentlemen . My friends . I am not much of a speechmaker , so I hardly know how to thank you . This young lady and myself have been practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill with which we shall be glad to entertain you . Alley . - Ready ? - Ready . Put on the lights . Uno momento . - Alley . - Oop . Linda . The club is adjourned . Julia , I 've got a grand surprise for you . Just a moment . Come down now . It 's nearly 12:00 and we want the entire party together to see the New Year in . The New Year comes into this room , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see the New Year in as I had planned , as I had asked you -- I think if you do n't mind we 'll go down and see what 's happened to the furnace . Julia , this is Nick and Susan . I told you about them . How do you do ? - And Mr . Seton . - Your friends are always welcome here . I 'll see you downstairs . Thank you , but as a matter of fact Susan has an awful run in her stocking . Why do n't you go down to my room ? It 's on the third floor . Fine . Congratulations on your engagement , Miss Seton . You 're not getting very much , but I 'm sure you can improve him . Kindly walk , do not run to the nearest exit . They 're grand people . - They 'll wait , do n't you think ? - I do n't know . I do n't know . There 's no cause for temper , child . Run along and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Listen to me , Father , tonight means a good deal to me . I do n't know what or how precisely . Something 's trying to take it away and I ca n't let it go . I 'll put in an appearance downstairs . Then I want to bring those people back here . I want to sit and have supper with them . We wo n't disturb anyone . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? Your place is downstairs . Once more , this is important to me . Do n't ask me why . It has something to do with this room when I was a child and good times in it . What special virtue this room has I 'm sure I do n't know . You do n't , do you ? No , you ca n't . I 'll tell you , this room 's my home , it 's the only home I 've got . There 's something here that I understand and that understands me . - Maybe it 's Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You thought I 'd come around . You always think people will come around . Not me , not tonight . And I sha n't be disturbed either ' cause if there 's one thing you hate , it 's a scene . I can promise you one if you interfere . I can promise you a beauty . Johnny , so there 's good news , is there ? Was Mother a sweet soul , Father ? Linda , if you 're not happy here why do n't you go away ? I 'll be glad if next month you take a maid and a companion and take a trip somewhere . You distress me . You cause nothing but trouble and upsets . That 's just what I 'm going to do . - No maid and no companion . Just me . - As you wish . I 've been dying to get out for years . I 've never known it so well as tonight . I ca n't stand it here any longer . It 's doing terrible things to me . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . This room . I do n't think you 'll be able to stand it long . I 'll come back when you 've left it . I do n't believe I need to worry about the way you 'll take care of Julia , need I ? We 'll try to manage , thanks , sir . Seton has told us of your very successful manipulations of Seaboard . I consider that a very fine piece of work . I congratulate you . Is n't it marvellous ? What a New Year . When you return from your honeymoon if I 'm not much mistaken there 'll be a desk waiting for you at the bank . That 's very kind of you , sir but the success of the Seaboard deal makes possible a certain plan of my own . But , Johnny ... . A plan ? Yes ? I 'm afraid I 'm not quite as anxious as I might be for the things most people work towards . I do n't want too much money . - Too much money ? - Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now , while I 'm young and feel good all the time . I 'm sure Julia understands what I 'm getting at , do n't you , Julia ? I 'm not sure I do , Johnny . You wish to occupy yourself otherwise , is that it ? Please do n't make me feel guilty about it . Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on . Even if I find I 've had enough of it in three months , I want it . If I let this chance go by , there 'll never be another for me so I do n't think anyone will mind if I just have a go at it , will they , Julia ? Will they , dear ? - Father , let Johnny and me talk awhile . - Just a moment . In all my experience -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you . Case , it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this . A very strange time . - Father . - I see , sir . Then ... . Then perhaps -- Father , please go down . We 'll come in a minute . He did n't get what I was driving at , at all . Why did you do it ? You knew all that talk would antagonize him . - You think talk is all it was ? - I think it was less than that . I 'm furious with you . It was n't just talk , Julia . You do n't realize what Father is offering you . Wait a minute , dear . - We 'd better get clear on this . - I 'm clear on it right now . If you think you can persuade me that a man of your energy and your ability possibly could quit at 30 ... . If you 're tired and want a rest , why , we 'll have it . Have n't you the remotest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . But you have n't any idea yet of how exciting business can be . See it through . You 'll love it . I know you will . There 's no such thrill in the world as making money . Darling , you do n't see what I 'm aiming at either . Try a little blind faith for a while , wo n't you ? - Come along with me ? - But -- No , the whole way , dear . Johnny , wait till next year or two years and we 'll think about it again . You can do that for me , for us , ca n't you ? You think by then I 'd be a good sport and come around , that 's what you think , do n't you ? It lacks six minutes to the New Year if anyone 's interested . Come on , Johnny . Have Nick and Susan gone ? I do n't know . They were n't in my room . - Perhaps they 're downstairs . - Perhaps . Anyone care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is plain stubbornness and you know it . Listen , Julia . No , that gets you nowhere , does it ? Are you coming ? I think I 'll wait a moment with Linda if you do n't mind . But I do mind . Will you come , please ? In a moment , Julia . You 'd better run on down now , do n't you think ? Not right away . I 'm afraid I wo n't know how to entertain you . I 've done all my stuff . I do n't need entertaining . You would n't care to step into a waltz as the old year dies , would you , Mr . Case ? Yes , I would . I 'd love it . There 's a conspiracy against you and me , child . What 's that ? - The vested interests . - I know . They wo n't let you have any fun and they wo n't give me time to think . I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Poor boy . What about your own evening ? Not so hot either . Poor girl . - Of course , they may be right . - Do n't you believe it . I do n't know . They seem so awfully sure . It 's still your ride , is n't it ? You know where you want to go , do n't you ? - I thought I did . - So did I . Pathetic , was n't it , all my fuss and fury over anything as unimportant as this party . Maybe it is important . Well , if it is , I 'm not , and I guess that 's the answer . Linda , you 're so sweet . Thanks , that 's enough . It was grand . Listen . That 's it , all right . Happy New Year , Johnny . Happy New Year , Linda . You can count on sister Linda , Johnny . Run on down now . They 'll be waiting . Linda . What ? They 've ... . - Your father put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Julia ? Of course I do . Well , if ever she needed you , she needs you now . You 're all that 's left . Go on , Johnny . Happy New Year . Same to you . - What 's it like to get drunk , Ned ? - It 's ... . How drunk ? Good and drunk . Grand . How is it ? Well , to begin with it brings you to life . Does it ? And after a while you begin to know all about it . You feel , I do n't know , important . That must be good . It is . And then pretty soon the game starts . What game ? A swell game , a terribly exciting game . You think clear as crystal but every move , every sentence is a problem . That gets pretty interesting . - You get beaten though , do n't you ? - Sure , but that 's good , too . Then you do n't mind anything , not anything at all . Then you sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . As long as you last . Ned , that 's awful . Think so ? Other things are worse . Where do you end up ? Where does everybody end up ? You die . And that 's all right , too . Ned , can you do it on champagne ? Why ? What 's the matter , Linda ? Nothing . - I know . - Yes ? Johnny . Give me some more wine , Ned . - He 's in a spot , is n't he ? - Give me some , Ned . You can tell me about it , dear . I love the boy , Neddie . I thought so . Great , is n't it ? Great . Here 's luck to you . I do n't want any luck . Ladies and gentlemen , my good friends , I have the honour to announce to you the engagement of my daughter Julia to Mr . John Case . An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Are n't you thrilled ? Is n't it -- - I am . - I 'm sure you 'll be very happy . - You 're thinking of my sister . - What ? - Not I ! My sister . Linda , now you must get married yourself . - Thank you . - I 'm so happy for you . Thank you for coming down . You must go back to bed . The doctor said you should n't excite yourself . What is this ? Where 's the lucky boy ? I have n't seen the lucky boy since the announcement . - Linda , did you know about it ? - Of course I did . - Where is he ? - That 's something I would n't know . I do n't know . He wanted to argue with Father . He did n't make sense . He said things to Father he had no right to say . Then after the announcement to go downstairs and leave us . It 's horrible . Please do n't be so upset . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . Of all times -- - Linda , is n't it too marvellous ? - Too , too marvellous . I 'll ... . - Linda , now you must get married . - I hope I shall . Linda needs to find a husband . - Hello . It is wonderful , is n't it ? - It 's simply lovely . - Hello . How 's Baltimore ? - It 's fine , thank you . - Have you seen Mr . Case anywhere ? - Mr . Case went through here a moment ago . Through there ? - Did Mr . Case come in here ? - Yes , ma'am , right through here , ma'am . " Happy New Year , " he says . Congratulations to Miss Julia , ma'am . Thank you . - Linda . Come in . - Hello , Susan . I 'm sorry to butt in . Well , as I live . Look , it 's the acrobat lady . - Glad to see you . - Glad to see you , too . Run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to call . - The phone 's been discontinued . We pay our bills . It 's that we 're planning a little trip . - You 're sailing ? - Tonight . Come on in and help us pack . The university gave me leave to work in France . And we 're doing our best ... . You ought to have some tea or something . You look peaked . I 've been hunting for Johnny . I thought he 'd be here . Have you seen him ? Not since that night . - You knew he walked out . - Yes . He came here and we talked until New Year 's noon . Then he left town to think things over . - His letter said he 'd be back today . - Then I can see him ! He 's probably on his way . Has n't your sister heard from him ? If she has , she has n't told me . - You love her a great deal , do n't you ? - Yes . A lot of good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your father does -- Johnny 'll fix that . Johnny 'll fix everything . If I could only make Julia and Father listen to me . I 've got to . Johnny 's so sweet , he 's so attractive . What 's the matter with the girl anyway ? She ought to know by now that men like Johnny do n't grow on every bush . Linda , is n't it just possible that the things we like in Johnny may be the very things she ca n't stand ? The fate that you feel he 'll save her from is the one fate in this whole world she wants ? I do n't believe that . Even so , she loves him and there 's been a break . Would n't you think she 'd be woman enough to hang on ? Yes , if she loves him . Julia has never in her life loved anyone but Johnny . - Perhaps herself . - That 's not true .

What 's the matter with me anyway ? Even if I told you what was the matter with you , you would n't admit it . - I do n't know what you 're talking about . - Pay no attention to her . If you did anything else then you would n't be what you are . Which to my professorial mind is head of the class . - I love you two . - And so do we love you . In our rough , uncouth way , of course . - Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon . - Yes ? He 's asking her to sail with us and with him tonight . - What do you think she 'll say ? - Yes . What if she does n't ? What happens then ? What 's Johnny to do ? What would you want him to do ? That may be he . Nicholas Porter ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Thanks . Julia will sail , she must , she 's got to . Good-bye . Julia . Hello , dear . You 'll be late for the Todds ' dinner , wo n't you ? You had luncheon with Johnny . He wants you to sail tonight . - You 've seen him ? - The Potters told me . You must sail with him . - The Potters ? Who are the Potters ? - Stop it , Julia . - Stop what ? - Pretending you do n't care . You 're taking my little difficulty more seriously than I am . Do n't let Johnny go off tonight and make a hash of both your lives . You ca n't let him sail alone . He 's no more sailing than you are . Does Father know you are n't going to the Todds ' dinner ? Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this ? I was n't aware that I was . Wo n't you just talk to me ? Please , Julia . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done it . Me ? Johnny and I have had a difference and you 're siding with him , are n't you ? But he 's right . - He 's right for you as well as for himself . - I think that 's for me to decide . - Not Father ? - Father has nothing to do with it . He happens to agree with me where you do n't . But ... . But we 've always agreed before , always . No . I think quite often I 've given in , in order to avoid scenes and upsets and ... . Is that true , Julia ? You 've always been the stronger character . At least people have always thought so . You 've made the decisions and had the ideas . And you 've been resenting me . I ca n't believe it . It 's nothing to get into a stew about . I did n't say I resented you . You 've been an immense help often . When it comes to determining my future and the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia ? What do you want , just security ? Sit back smugly in your bank vault among the worthies of the world ? One thing I do n't want is to start this endless discussion all over again . You 've only 20 minutes in which to dress . Linda , did you hear me ? Father , I think you 're both giving Johnny the rottenest kind of a deal . - In what way ? - In every way . - You 're not thinking of what 's best for him . - On the contrary . The young man 's outlook has merely become somewhat confused . - You 'll straighten it out for him . - We shall try . But why has n't he the right to live part of his life as he wants to ? Linda , I should like to understand what he and you are aiming at but I confess , I can not . I consider his whole attitude un-American . - Are you serious ? - Entirely . Then he is and he wo n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life devoted to piling up money is all it 's cracked up to be . Strange , is n't it , when he has us right before his eyes for such a shining example ? I listened most attentively the other day to our young dreamer and I still must confess that the talk of the two of you seems to me of the 17-year-old variety . I 'm glad if it is . We 're grand at 17 . It 's after that , that sickness sets in . Well , I feel very well myself . You both think he 'll come around . Compromise , anyway . You 'll get fooled . He wo n't give way one inch . - Stubborn ? - No , right and knows he 's right . What 's the matter , kid ? I ca n't believe it , Ned . Johnny 's clearing out . He 's sailing tonight and Julia wo n't lift a finger to stop him . I do n't understand her . Most people , including Johnny and yourself , make a big mistake about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At bottom she 's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in . You 've just never hit it off , that 's all . - Ned . - What ? You remember what we talked about on New Year 's Eve ? Sure , I remember . - Tell me something . - Sure . Does it stand out all over me ? Why ? Nick and Susan , this afternoon . I think they got it . Anyone who loves you would , Linda . That 's awful . I 'm so ashamed . I 'm not , though . Why should you be ? Pardon me , Miss Linda . - Yes , Henry . - Mr . Case is downstairs . Have him come up , will you , Henry ? And , Henry , tell Miss Julia . He 'll be up in a minute . Are you sure you want to get over him ? No , I 'm not and that 's what scares me most . I feel alive and I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it ca n't get anywhere so it 's like living on that stuff . - I 've got to get over it . - Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? Seems ? What do you mean ? Do n't you know ? Let me tell you something . You 're twice as attractive as Julia ever thought of being . You 've got twice the looks , twice the mind and 10 times the quality . You could charm a bird off a tree if you would and why not ? If you were in her way she 'd ride you down like a rabbit . How could you , Ned , knowing the way she loves him ? - How could you ? - All right , Linda . Tell him hello for me , will you ? - Hello , Linda . - Hello , Johnny . I sent for Julia . I feel as if I 'd been away quite a while . Yeah . - I went to Placid . - I see . It was ... . - It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to take that job at the bank . - I see . Only for a while , only for a couple of years . Just until I can get it through to her that ... . It was what she asked and after all , a couple of years is n't a lifetime . - Is it ? - Of course not . - I think everything will be all right , Johnny . - Sure . I can see the way they feel about it . I could hardly expect them to do a complete , sudden about-face but ... . But , hang it , why ca n't they see what I 'm getting at ? Perhaps eventually they will . That 's what I 'm counting on . Linda you agree there 's only one thing for me to do now , do n't you ? Compromise ? Yes . Yes . You think that 's right , do n't you ? - I do n't think it matters a bit what I think . - It does though , Linda . You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's right . Johnny , when two people love each other as much as you do anything that keeps them apart must be wrong . - Good evening . - Good evening , sir . They tell me you 've been away . Pleasant having you back . It 's pleasant to be back . There 's been a rather noticeable absence of snow these recent weeks . Quite . Father , Johnny came tonight to see Julia . That does n't surprise me a great deal , Daughter , not a great deal . Julia , not you and me . Come on , Dada , let 's go bye-bye . Good evening , Johnny . - Get your coat , darling , we 're going out . - Yes , dear . Father , could you explain to the Todds ? Please , close the door . I wish to speak with you both . You insist on putting me into a position that I do n't in the least relish . Who 's there ? Come in , Ned . - Sorry . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Son . Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention . For love , true love , is a very rare and beautiful thing . Where are you going ? Please , sit down . And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love , contrary to the adage , should run smooth . I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation . It is of paramount importance -- - I beg your pardon , sir ? - Yes ? If that position at the bank is still open I 'll be glad to take it . I 'm still not convinced . I still do n't believe in it , but it 's what Julia wishes and ... . And I 'm glad to defer to her wish . - You 're not convinced , you say ? - Would you like me to lie to you , sir ? Father , it 's enough for me . Julia said a year or two . I 'll do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only one reservation . If , at the end of that time , I still think it 's wise for me to quit ... - ... there wo n't be any objections . - I doubt there 'll be reason for any . We shall have to see about that . Well , Father ? - When is it you wish to be married ? - As soon as possible . Now the sun shines once more and we 're all friends again . And now what are your plans for your wedding trip , may I ask ? - We have n't any definite -- - It 's wise to prearrange honeymoons . Now let me suggest a little itinerary . You will land at Plymouth or Southampton and proceed straight to London . I shall cable my sister tomorrow . They will be delighted to have you stay with them . He is one of the most important men in British banking circles . You could scarcely go abroad and not stop with your Aunt Helen , Julia . In addition it will save hotel expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable the Bovays in Paris . He 's expert adviser to the Minister of Finance . A valuable man for you to know . I had thought of this as a honeymoon more than a business trip , sir . There 's no harm in combining a little business with pleasure . I 've never found there was . They have a lovely place , Johnny , just outside of Paris . Now a week in London , a week in Paris , 10 days in the South of France , ideal . Then you could sail from Genoa and return by southern route . I 'll arrange to have your house ready for you March 1 . Thanks , darling . What house is that , Julia ? Father 's lending us a place on 64th Street . Wait till you see it . This is not to be a gift you know , not yet . After you 've occupied it for some time my hard old heart may soften . Listen to him , his hard old heart . Would you also arrange for the servants ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Would you mind telling me what you mean ? I thought this was a trial for a couple of years . If we begin with possessions and obligations we could never get out from under them . No ! No . You 've been extremely kind and generous , but it 's not for us . - But you ... . You said that -- - I 'm back where I was , Julia . I can see now it 's got to be a clean break , it 's simply got to . We 've got to make our own life , there 's nothing to it if we do n't . There 's no other way to live it . Forget about wedding invitations and all the rest of it . Let 's get married tonight . - I must decide now , must I ? - Please . And if I say no ? I 'm going tonight by myself . Very well then . You can go . I suppose the fact is I love feeling free even better than I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make a go of it . Thanks for trying anyway . Good-bye to you , Linda . You 've been sweet . Good-bye , Johnny . I hope you find what you 're looking for . I hope you do . Linda . Please , do . Good-bye , Ned . I 'll miss that man . He 's gone . - Yes , and in my opinion -- - Good riddance . - He 's really gone . - Never mind . He loves you , he 'll be back . Be back ? " Be back , " did you say ? What do you think I am ? I hope this experience , hard as it may have been -- Do n't worry about me . I 'm all right . Even a little more than all right , I should say . - What 's with you ? Will you kindly -- - You do n't love him . Answer me . Do you or not ? - What 's that to you ? - You do n't , do you ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . - Suppose I am ? - She asks me , suppose she is ! - Are you ? Say it . - I 'm so relieved I could sing with it . - Is that what you want ? - Yes , thanks . Neddie , Neddie , have I got a job now . Is your passport in order ? Mine is . What do you say ? - Well , when ? - Now . Tonight . - I do n't think I could . - Sure you could . If I can , you can . - Where are you off to ? - Will you come ? - Where are you going ? - On a trip . On a big ride . Do you mind ? Will you come , Ned ? - Listen , Father -- - A trip now is out of the question . - You won't . - Can't . - Caught ? - Maybe . - I 'll be back for you , Ned . - I 'll be here . You 've got no faith in Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you think . What if it should ? There will be another . I 've got faith in Johnny . Whatever he does is all right with me . If he wants to dream for a while , he can and if he wants to come back and sell peanuts , how I 'll believe in those peanuts . Good-bye , Julia . Good-bye , Father . - Good-bye , Neddie . - Good-bye , kid . Good luck . Never you fear , I 'll be back for you , my fine bucko . All right . Linda . Try and stop me , someone . Please someone try and stop me . I shall not permit it . I shall ... . - Permit Linda ? Do n't make me laugh . - She 's going with him , is n't she ? Is n't she ? - Going to get her Johnny . - A fine chance she 's got . Any bets ? Any bets , Julia ? To Linda . And while we 're at it , Grandfather . Dear , what a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please stop it , Nick ? I ca n't stop it , Susan . I 'm miserable . Thinking of him I should say . - Shut up , dearest . - For two cents , I 'd call off the whole thing . - Johnny . - Johnny . My word . - Where 's Julia ? - I left her sitting on her golden throne . - Johnny is taking the big ride by himself . - No . Boy , champagne , any amount of it , but hurry . - Oui , Monsieur Porter . - The name is Potter . Let 's change our name to Porter . Then they 'll call us Potter . What happened ? I 've just wakened out of a nightmare . Everything will be all right . I know it is . Come on , children , come on . Is this where the club meets ? Right here .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting . - What do you mean ? I do nt understand - I 'll show you . Look Here I saw the whole thing . Now then , there 's Hammond , there 's the bowler , there 's the umpire . - Sugar ? - Two , please . Dear me , there is no sugar . Watch this very very carefully , Caldicott . Grimmet was bowling . May I trouble you for the sugar , please ? - What ? - The sugar , please . Thank you so much . If I were you , I 'd try and get a little sleep . It 'll make you feel well . There 's an intriguing acrostic in The Needlewoman . I 'm going to try and unravel it before you wake up . Reservations for lunch , please . - Madam has booked for lunch ? - My friend did , she 's got the ticket . - Have you seen my friend ? - No ? Erm , my friend , where is she ? La signora inglese , the English lady , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . - What ? - There has been no English lady here . - There has . She sat there , in the corner . You saw her , you spoke to her . She sat next to you . Ridiculous , She took me to the dining car and came back here with me . You went and came back alone . May be you do nt understand , I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out . Ah , perhaps it make-a you forget , eh ? I may be very dense , but if this is some part of a joke , I 'm afraid I do n't see the point . - Oh , Steward , you served me tea just now - Yes , madam . - Have you seen the lady I was with ? english lady ? - But madam was alone . - Pardon , he make mistake . - Well ofcourse , He must remember the little English lady . - She ordered the tea and paid for it . - It is you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - but She gave you a special packet of tea . you can't forgot me that - The tea was ours madam , but I receive no packet . - But you did.I know what happened . - Pardon , madam , the bill . - Er , tea for one . - But that 's not right . Perhaps madam would examine the bills ? No , the whole thing 's too absurd . Please , have you seen a lady pass through ... ? Oh . Well , if it is n't old stinker If I thought you 'd be on this train , I 'd have stayed another week in the hotel . - Er , lady , no , why ? - Does n't matter . You probably would n't recognise one anyway . Hello ? Feeling queer ? It 's that pipe of yours . Why do n't you throw your old socks away ? Thanks for the help . - Oh Come on , sit down , Take it easy what 's the trouble ? - You must know Something fell on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . - Bad luck . Can I help ? - Only by going away . Noo NO No . My father always taught me , never desert a lady in trouble . He even went as far as marrying mother . - Did you see a lady last night in hotel in tweeds ? - I saw one lady , hardly in tweeds . - She was in my compartment.i couldn't find her - She must be still on the train.We have n't stopped yet - Of course.Still on the train I know that . - All right . Nobody said she isn't . - That 's just what they are saying . - Who ? The people in the compartment and the stewards . - All of them ? - All of them . - You said you got a knock on the head ? - What do you mean ? - Never mind . Do you talk the lingo ? - No . They probably thought you wanted money . Let 's knock the idea out of their stupid heads . Unfortunate remark , I beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark man . I say , Excuse me , there 's been a misunderstanding . This young lady has lost her friend . yes , I have heard . This gentleman has been explaining to me . Most interesting . - I think under circumstances , we shall all introduce ourselves . - I am Italian citizen . - My wife and child . - How do you do . Bonny chap , how old ? 1934 . And the lady in the corner is the Baroness Attorna . Yes . I met her husband.He presented crisis at the folk dance festival . Minister of Propaganda . I am Dr Egon Hartz of Prague . You may have heard of me . - The brain specialist ? - The same . You flew to England and operated on a cabinet minister . - Yes . - Did you find anything ? - A slight cerebral contusion . - that's Better than nothing . I am picking up a similar case at the next station.so much more complicated I shall operate at the hospital tonight . A cranial fracture with compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beam . - I suppose You have n't seen my friend ? - Unfortunately No . I 'll just take a word with the baroness . - Scusi , avete visto la signora ? - No . Non I'ha vista . - What do they say ? - They say that they 've never seen her . - But that was n't true , she was sitting where you are . - Can you describe her ? But that 's difficult you see , She was sort of middle age . - What was she wearing ? - Tweeds . Oatmeal , flecks of brown , a three-quarter coat with patch pockets , a scarf , felt hat , brown shoes , a tussore shirt and a small , blue handkerchief in her breast pocket . - I ca n't remember any more . - You were n't paying attention ! - You both went along to tea ? - Yes . - Surely you met somebody ? - I suppose we did , but ... Wait .. let me think . There was an Englishman who passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig him out . - I come with you . This is more interesting to me We do n't like people muscling in but we 'll make you a member . Wait , when passed this compartment Miss Froy stumbled in There was a tall gentleman and a lady . Alrite , Now we are getting some , If we can find someone who saw her , we 'll search the place . - Can I be of assistance ? - That 's the gentlemen Do you remember seeing this lady pass here with a little English woman ? I 'm , er , I 'm afraid not . But you must have . She almost fell into your compartment . It 's very important . Everybody 's saying she was n't on the train but I know she is . I 'm going to find her , even if I have to stop the train to do it . Caldicott , this is Charters , can I come in ? That girl we saw at the hotel is kicking up a devil of a fuss . - Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . - She threatens to stop the train . - Oh , Lord . If we miss our connection , we wo n't make Manchester in time . - This is serious . - Let 's hide in here . Sorry , I have n't the faintest recollection . You must be making a mistake . Well , He obviously does n't remember . Let 's go and look for the other fellow . Who were you talking to , outside ? Oh , nobody . Just , er , some people in the corridor , arguing . - There he is . That 's the man . - Oh , I wonder if I could bother you ? - I wonder if you can help ? - How ? I was having tea with an English lady . You saw her ? did n't you - I do n't know , I was talking to my friend . - Indubitably . Yes , You were sitting in the next table She turned and borrowed the sugar . - You must remember . - I recall passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discussing cricket . I do n't see how a thing like cricket can make you forget . If that 's your attitude , obviously there 's nothing more to say . Come , Caldicott . Thing like cricket ! We should have said we were looking for a lost cricket ball . - yes , but he spoke to her , There must be some explanation . - There is . Please forgive me , iam quite possibly be wrong , but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow - has induced a most vivid impression . - I understand . - You do n't believe me . - It 's not a question of belief . Even a concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person . Yes , But I can remember every little detail . Her name , Miss Froy , everything . So interesting . you know If one had time , one could trace the cause of the hallucination . - Hallucination ? - oh ! Precisely . There is no Miss Froy , there was n't Miss Froy merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night at the hotel . - You thought you did . - But what about the name ? - Some past association , an advertisement or a character in a novel , subconsciously remembered . There is no reason to be frightened , if you are quiet and relax . Thank you very much . If you will excuse me , this is where my patient comes aboard . Excuse me . Most interesting . - Stopping . - This is the first stop , is n't it ? - Mm-hm . - oh then Miss Froy must still be on the train . you Look out of this window and see if she gets off this side . I 'll take the other . Most interesting . - What was she dressed in , Scotch tweeds ? - Oatmeal tweeds . I knew it had something to do with porridge . How long does it take to get a divorce ? - Eric ? - I-I beg your pardon . I was n't listening . - I said how long does it take to get a divorce ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could take our honeymoon next spring . - I mean , the official one . - The difficulties are considerable . but , one thing The courts are very crowded just now . Although we barristers ought not to complain about that . With conditions as they are now , my chances of becoming a judge are rosy . That is , if nothing untoward occurs . Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case . - Yes In that first careless rapture , you said did n't care what happened . The law , like Caesar 's wife , must be above suspicion . Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar 's wife ? - Look here Now I know why you 've been running around like a scared rabbit . - Why you lied a few minutes ago . - I lied ? Yes , to those people in the corridor . I heard every word you said . merely , I did n't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry . Inquiry ! Just because a little woman ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman had disappeared and I 'd admitted having seen her , we might become vital witnesses . My name might appear in the papers , coupled with yours . A scandal like that might lead anywhere . - Anywhere . - Yes . I suppose it might . - Nobody ? - Nobody . All that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag . I know there 's a Miss Froy . She 's real as you are That 's what you saying , I believe it but does nt appear nobody else has seen her . I saw her , I think . You did ? - A little woman in tweeds wearing 3 quarter clothes - With a scarf ? - that's rite - I saw her with you when you passed the compartment - I knew I was right . - But Your husband said he had n't seen her . - He did n't notice but as soon as he mentioned it I remembered at once You win . This calls for action . Would you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pardon , my patient has just arrived.most fascinating complication We 've some news . This lady actually saw Miss Froy . - So We shall have the train searched . - You like to think a fresh theory . doctor ? It is n't not Necessary , My theory was perfectly good one . The facts were misleading . - I hope you find your friend . Excuse me . - I 'll be in here if you want me Right you are . Come along . Eric . I was only going to mention that i told that girl that I 'd seen her friend . - Have you taken leave of your senses ? - On the contrary . I 've come to them . - What do you mean ? - If there 's scandal , there 'd be a divorce . You could n't let me down.could you You will have to do the decent thing , - as reluctantly as only you know how . - You forget one important thing , Margaret . Your husband would divorce you but whatever happens my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to search the train . Ah , signorina ... Your friend , she come back . - Come back ? - S ? , s ? . - But what happened ? - You go see . She tell you . Scusi . Thanks . All right , relax , the crisis is over . come on , Let 's join the lady . - Here we are . - Miss Froy . - That is n't Miss Froy . - Is n't it ? - No . - It 's silly to say but are you Miss Froy ? No . I am Madam Kummer . She helped you into the carriage , then went to see some friends . As you spoke of the English lady , she did n't connect her with Madam Kummer . But she was n't the lady i saw . It was Miss Froy . - Oatmeal tweeds , blouse ... - yes I know , everything 's the same - but it is n't her . beg your pardon - When did you meet Miss Froy ? - Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume like this ? - Yes , I think so . - Then I must apologise . You did meet her . - Then ... - But not on this train . In your subconscious , you substituted Miss Froy for Madam Kummer . but I did n't . I could n't have actually I talked to her here . An English lady saw her . If this lady would n't mind ... Bon , apr ? s vous , madame . What a gift for languages the fellow 's got . Would you tell us , is this the woman you saw ? It is n't a bit like her , is it ? - Yes , she 's the woman . - It is n't , I tell you . Are you sure ? - Perfectly . - She is n't , she is n't . Come on , then . I 'm so sorry to have troubled you . Well ? Are n't you going to say anything ? - You might at least gloat , if nothing else . - You only did it to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in her face . They 're all lying , but why ? Why do n't you sit down ? take it easy Do you think I substituted Miss Froy 's face for Madam Kummer 's ? - I think a change 'd be an improvement . - Miss Froy was on this train and nothing will convince me otherwise . Must you follow me round like a pet dog ? Let 's say a watchdog , I 've got all the better instincts . Goodbye . The doctor was right , I never saw Miss Froy on the train . I 'm glad you 're gon na take it like that . Forget all about it . Make your mind a complete blank . Watch me , you ca n't go wrong . - What about something to eat ? - Anything . - that's rite come along Would you like a little air ? - Thanks . - Can you eat anything ? - I could try . - that's the spirit You 'll feel a different girl tomorrow . - I hope so . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your what ? I 'm being married on Thursday . - Quite sure you 're not imagining that ? - Positive . Oh , I was afraid so . Ah , food . - I could n't face it . - Mind if I talk with my mouth full ? - If you must . - Care to hear about my early life ? - I do n't think so . - Well then , I 'll begin with my father . you know It 's remarkable how many great men began with their father . Drink ? - A cup of tea , please . My father was a very colourful character and he was strongly addicted to ... You 'll never guess ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . - No ! Double scotch . - A million Mexicans drink it . - Maybe but Father did n't . Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it . - A packet of what ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . We agreed you 'd make your mind a complete blank . - But it 's so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did we not ? We did . Sorry . Go on telling me about your father . My father was a very remarkable man . - Did he play the clarionet ? - He did . He never put it down unless it was absolutely necessary . I could n't help inheriting his love of music . - Why not ? - It was all he left me . You know , you 're remarkably attractive . Has anyone ever told you ? We were discussing you . - Yes , of course . Do you like me ? - Not much . After I 'd paid my father 's debts , I started to travel , until they tried to cash the cheques . I 'm writing a book now . Would you like to buy a copy ? I 'd love to . When will it be out ? About four years . - That 's a very long time . - It 's a very long book . Do you know why you fascinate me ? I 'll tell you . You have got two qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all and you 're always seeing things . - What 's the matter ? - Look . - It 's gone ! - What 's gone ? Miss Froy 's name on the window . you saw it You must have seen it ! She is on the train Now , steady , steady . We 've got to find her . Something 's happening to her . Stop the train . Listen everybodyThere 's a woman on this train - Miss Froy . They 're hiding her somewhere . I appeal to you to stop the train . Please help me . Make them stop the train . Why do n't you do something before it 's too late ? - Please . - You think I 'm crazy but I 'm not . For heaven 's sake Stop this train ! Leave me alone . - Leave me alone ! Huh ! Ten minutes late thanks to that fool of a girl . She gets up to any more tricks , we 'll be too late for the match . - I suppose you could n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't vanish and so forth . - She has . - What ? Vanished . - Who ? - The old dame . - Yes . - Well . - Well , how could she ? - What ? - Vanish . - I do n't know . That explains my point . People do n't disappear into thin air . - It 's done in India . - What ? - The rope trick . - Oh , that . It never comes out in a photograph . Look , in half an hour we 'll stop at Morshkan , just before the border . I will leave there with my patient for the National Hospital . If you come with me , you can stay overnight in a private ward . - You need rest . - Sorry , nothing doing . Is n't there anything we can do ? Yes . Find Miss Froy . I tell you , if she does not rest , I will not answer for her . You persuade her , she likes you . I 'm as popular as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , she may swallow it . Cosmopolitan trains . People of all nations . I 've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor . I thought I 'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr Hartz said . If you fell like changing your mind , I 'll be hanging around . - What 's all the mystery ? - Miss Froy is on this train . I 've just seen that packet of tea in the rubbish . - She may be dead now . - Dead or ... For sheer variety , give me an English summer ... We 'll search the train . There 's something definitely queer here . Looks like a supply service for trunk murderers . Look at that ! - All right , Miss Froy , it 's only us . - Hurry up . Perhaps it 's Miss Froy bewitched ! I refuse to be discouraged . Faint heart never found old lady . - Do you know anything about her ? - No . Only that she was a governess going back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might be something down here . - What on earth ... ? - Our Italian friend . I 've got it ! Wait a minute . There you are , the Great Doppo . - His visiting card , look . - What 's it say ? Magician , illusionist , mind-reader see his fascinating act , the vanishing ... lady . - The vanishing lady ? - Perhaps that 's the explanation . - What ? - He 's practising on Miss Froy . - Perhaps it 's a publicity stunt . - No . What about the Baroness and Madame Kummer ? - What 's your theory ? - I do n't know . My theory ? I 'll tell you . Oh , dear ! I ca n't get ... - Where are you ? - In here . With a smell of camphor ball . - I ca n't see you . - I 'm about somewhere . - Here I am . Where are you ? - I do n't know . This is what comes of not saying abracadabra . - Ooh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , out of it . - Not much . - Come and sit down . - What is that ? In magic circles , we call it the disappearing cabinet . - You get inside and you vanish . - So I noticed . You were about to tell me of your theory . Oh , my theory . Well ... my theory , my dear Watson , is that we are in very deep waters indeed . - Ahem . - Oh ! Thank you very much . Let us marshal our facts over a pipe full of shag . A little old lady disappears , everyone who saw her insists she was never there , right ? - Right . - We know that she was , therefore they did see her and so are lying . - Why ? - I do n't know . I 'm only Watson . Do n't bury yourself in the part . They dare n't face an enquiry as Miss Froy 's still on this train . - I told you that hours ago . - Yes , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Ooh , thank you . only onething we got to do we must search the train in disguise . - As what ? Well , er ... - English gentleman . - They 'd see through you . Perhaps you 're right . Aha ! Will Hay . Now , boys , boys , which of you has stolen Miss Froy ? Own up ! - Give those glasses to me . - Why ? - They 're Miss Froy's . - Are you sure ? Yes . Where did you find them ? - Down here . The glass is broken . - Probably in the struggle . Do you realise that this is our first piece of tangible proof ? That 's the lot . Will you please give me those spectacles ? They belong to me . Please . - Are you sure ? - Datemi questi occhiali ! Naughty , naughty . That 's a large nose for a small pair of spectacles . That 's the game , is it ? We 'll see about that . They 're Froy 's glasses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that too . Do n't stand there hopping about , kick him , see if he 's got a false bottom . Hang on , I 'll get him up . Ow ! That does n't help . Quick , pull his ears back . Give them a twist . Now I 've got him . He 's got a knife . Get hold of it before he cuts a slice off me . I ca n't reach it . Aah ! Well done , that 's it . That 's it . We know how that thing works , come out of there . Is he out ? We 've got to hide him somewhere . - What 's in here ? - Hurry up , quick , before he comes to . It 's empty . We can lock it . Come on . - Oh , no , you don't . - What 's the matter ? Garlic . I 'll be all right in a minute . - Here , let 's tie him up . - Oh , yes . So we definitely know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here had something to do with it . That ought to keep him quiet till we find her . Hard work but worth it . Let 's have the evidence . - Evidence ? - The glasses . - You 've got them . - No , I have n't got them . - Oh ! - He 's got them . He is n't there ! Snookered ! It 's a false bottom . - The twister ! He 's a contortionist . - He 's gone . To find the others . We ca n't fight the whole train , we need allies . - But who can we trust ? - That 's the snag . There 's that Dr Hartz person . Yes , you 're right . Let 's show him the symptoms . Oh , wait a minute . This is the one . He 's not there . Listen ... I 've just had a particularly idiotic idea . - I can believe that . - Supposing that patient is Miss Froy . It did n't come on the train till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's find the doctor . - No , wait a minute . - What is it ? Notice anything wrong about that nun ? - No . I do n't think she 's a nun , they do n't wear high heels . Yes , you 're right . Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train ? - No . - Well ... supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her , the first stop , a patient comes aboard , all wrapped up , the patient is Madame Kummer , she becomes Miss Froy , Miss Froy becomes that . But why go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless governess ? Maybe it is n't a governess at all . Perhaps it 's some political thing . Let 's investigate . Parlez vous fran ? ais ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? You 'll just have to cope with English . Can we look at your patient ? Thank you . Keep an eye on the nun . What are you doing here ? Why are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no business to be here . leave her view Dr Hartz , we want you to Undo bandages and to look at your patient 's face . Are you out of your senses ? There is no face there . Nothing but lumps of raw flesh . that is the case He has lost so much blood only a transfusion can save him . - Do You want me to murder my patient ? - You 're sure this is your patient ? - We believe it 's Miss Froy . - Miss Froy ! You ca n't be serious ? Whatever put such ideas into your head ? - I understand she 's deaf and dumb . - But she may lip-read . It 's possible . In that case , perhaps you 'll join me in the dining car . I 'll be with you in a moment , I want to be sure my patient has n't been disturbed . How do I know how they cottoned on ? Somebody must have tipped ' em off . You never said the old girl was English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments I shall order three drinks in the dining car . Mine will be chartreuse . One of the stewards is working for us , now , listen.carefully There 's that girl again . Seems to have recovered . Lucky it blew over . Now , tell me what this is all about . Have you ever seen your patient ? No . I just had a message to operate at Morshkan . - How do you know it 's not Miss Froy ? - We believe it 's a substitution . - You really think ... that someone else - tararar umm ... Oh , I want a green chartreuse . - Wo n't you join me ? - Thanks . A large brandy . - And you ? - I do n't want anything . - Come on . - No , really . It 'll pick you up . All right , just a small one . Two brandies and a chartreuse . Do you know anything about the nun who 's looking after your patient ? Nun ! , No , only that she 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's peculiar that she 's wearing high-heeled shoes . Oh , is she ? That is rather curious , is n't it ? It 's a conspiracy . All these people on the train say they have n't seen Miss Froy but they have .. , we know that , because just now in the luggage van .. She 's off again . Hope she does n't create another scene . Put the lid on our getting back in time . ... and then this fella Doppo came and grabbed the glasses . Yeah , we had a bit of a fight . - Oh , a fight ? - We knocked him out . Oh ! - He 's made a speedy recovery . - Yes . All that 's just bluff . - Here . - Grazie . How could he be involved in a conspiracy ? Look at the poor fellow , he 's just a harmless traveller . - He 's also a music-hall artist on tour . - Well ? The baroness 's husband is Minister of Propaganda , he can cancel his tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewards do n't behave , they have a cosy brick wall to run up against . B-But tell me about the English travellers , they denied seeing her . Just British diplomacy , never climb a fence if you can sit on it . I ca n't understand why anyone would want to dispose of the old lady . That 's what stumps us but she was on this train and now she 's ... gone . Well ... if you 're right then the whole train is against us . What are we going to do ? In view of what you just told me , I-I shall risk examining the patient . - Come on ... - One moment . We must n't act suspicious , behave as is if nothing had happened . A drink , that 'll steady your nerve . To our health . And may our enemies , if they exist , be unconscious of our purpose . Let 's go , we must hurry now . Come on , drink up . Wait in here . Go on . - Anything wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels . However , it makes no difference . We shall reach Morshkan in three minutes . Quite an eventful journey . Well ? Yes , the patient is Miss Froy . She will be taken off the train at Morshkan . She will be removed to the hospital and operated on . Unfortunately , the operation will not be successful . Oh , I should perhaps have explained . The operation will be performed ... by me . You see , I am in this conspiracy , as you term it . You are a very alert young couple but it 's quite useless to think of a way out of your dilemma . The drinks you had just now . I regret to say contained a quantity of hydrocin . FYI , It is a little-known drug which has the effect , in a small quantity , of paralysing the brain and rendering the victim unconscious for considerable period . In a slightly larger quantity , of course , it induces madness . However , you have my word the dose was a normal one . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say how sorry I am having to take such a ... How shall I say ? Melodramatic course . But your persistent meddling made it necessary . - Are you all right ? You fainted . - Did I ? Listen ! There is a woman next door is going to be murdered and we 've got to go before this stuff takes effect . I read that if you keep going , you can stay awake . Right . Let 's get going . It 's locked . We ca n't go that way , we 'll be spotted . - You ca n't do that ! - Do n't worry , it 's only next door . You stand on your head , touch ur toes , anything , only , whatever you do , do n't fall asleep . Go on , you need n't be afraid , it is Miss Froy . You have n't been drugged . He told me to put something in your drink but I did n't . Who the devil are you ? He said you are deaf dumb Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got to hurry . Hartz will be back in a min , what will happen then ? If we can hold him off till get past Morshkan , the frontier 's a few miles beyond the station . Come on , there 's still time . - 500 solamente ? Dopo tutto quello che ho fatto ? Cosa poi di questo orecchio mozzicato da quella ragazza ? That 's Morshkan . Have you finished ? Come on , Miss Froy . Cut it out , you 're not drugged . I 'll explain later . Abracadabra . Miss Froy ! Oh , I ca n't believe it ! - Thank you , my dear . Thank you . - Careful . - Ready ? - Yes . Are you all right miss Froy ? Yes . thankyou It 's like rush hour on the underground . Careful , it 's slowing down . Drat . I 'm sorry you 've had such an uncomfortable journey , Miss Froy . Get back on the train . I hope nothing goes wrong . Are n't we stopping rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off soon . In a few minutes we 'll be over the border . No , I 've been well-paid but this was murder and she was an English woman . - You are Bandrikan ? - My husband was . I 'm English . You were going to butcher her in cold blood Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady but two others as well . You ca n't do that . Also , it would be unwise of us to permit the existence of anyone who can not be trusted . - You would n't dare . I know too much . - Precisely . I think we 're over the border now . - You can come out , Miss Froy . - Oh , bless me . What an unpleasant journey . Never mind . You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way .

Have you really got 20 notches in your gun ? Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps in your war bag ? Had to throw ' em away . The moths got to them . Tanning ' em the best way to keep them . - Is that a fact ? - That 's what my pa told me . - What are you doing with that ? - Trying get bark off to make a whistle . - Have you sucked it ? - I sucked it till it near dry . Ca n't you shoot the insides out ? - Put it up on that post . - Ca n't I hold it ? - Can you hold it steady ? - Sure ! Billy , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . Turn the end up a little . Little more . You hit it ! - Do n't you take aim ? - I took aim . - When ? - Before I drew . Look , Billy , it 's all right . You fixed it fine . Thanks . - Glad to help . - Anything I can do , let me know . - That 's a new one on me . - What ? Aiming before you draw . - I 've got to . - Why ? My hand seems to be a little quicker than my eye . Well , ai n't that too bad . - Where 'd you get the horse ? - I bought this one . - Looks all right . - He 'll do for the time being . Ham and eggs . Fry the eggs on both sides . I 'll take the same . Mine straight up . How ' bout a cold hand while we 're waiting ? How much ? - How 's that ? - Suits me . Before you get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Who is he ? - I do n't know . - What do you want ? - Let 's go in the backroom . Why ? You do n't know me , but we have a mutual friend . Who ? And I do n't like him any better than you do . Oh , Garrett , eh ? The name sounds familiar . - Figure on staying in town tonight ? - Why ? Everybody knows that Garrett told you to get out of town . Sooner or later you 're gon na have a little trouble with him . I thought I might give you a hand . That 's very kind of you , mister . Listen . I ai n't doing you no favor . It 'll be a pleasure . Now what I figure is when he 's arguing with you , he wo n't watch anyone else . So , it 'll be a cinch for me . Be careful you do n't knock me over with the same bullet . Do n't worry . I 'll stand at an angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Garrett there . And if you 're standing about where you are ... why , I 'll be over here . Do you mind if I draw my gun so you can see the line of fire ? No , go right ahead . - It 's me , Billy . - Come on in , Doc . - What happened ? - He 's a pretty smart hombre . You know him ? He 's been hanging around trying to talk Garrett into making him a deputy . I guess he figured if he got Billy he 'd be a hero ... he could have the deputy job , or run for governor if he wanted it . - Better get out of here , son . - Why ? He pulled on me first . - Be hard to make Garrett believe that . - We 'll see . Where 's my dough ? Well , I guess I must 've picked it up . You 're foolish to stick around , son . I think I 'd be more foolish to pull out . Then Garrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cut for deal . - You meant you want to play poker . - That 's right . You 're not worried about me if I tangle with Garrett , are you ? Fights pretty good . I know him better than you do . All right , if he 's so good ... then you 'll get your horse back , wo n't you ? Say , I never thought of that . What 's the matter ? Nothing . - Lend me a hundred . - I never lend money in a poker game . Spoils my luck . But I 'd be glad to have you put up the horse for a hundred . I guess you would . Hello , Pat . Care for a bite to eat , boys ? A little hand of poker ? No thanks , Doc . Were you in there when it happened ? No . But listen , Pat , he pulled on Billy first . - How do you know ? - His gun was on the floor . That do n't prove nothing . Pat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it get the best of you . You have no right to hold Billy for this killing , and you know it . You 're just sore at him , that 's all . Doc , I 'm gon na give you a chance to stay out of this . - Thanks . - Your horse is outside . Get on him . - Good luck to you . - Same to you . What are you waitin ' for ? He 's waiting for those chickens of yours to hatch . Are you gon na put up a fight ? I 'll tell you one thing . I ai n't going to jail for no killing I was pushed into . - Thanks , Doc . - What are you trying to do ? I still think that fella pulled first on Billy . Are you throwing off on me again ? Then what do you call it ? Since I figure that this is a personal matter between you and Billy ... I do n't think you ought to bring in all this hired help . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... so I would n't have to kill him . Do you stuff birds too ? You 're making a big mistake ... turning on an old friend , all because of a little snip ... who 's never given anybody nothing except the back of his hand . Speaking of hands ... Come on . Let 's get out of here before this hothead makes us plug him . He ai n't gon na run me out of town . If you wan na hold the fort while I ride off on your little horse ... it 's all right with me . Well , since you put it that way . Go ahead , son . Take it easy , Pat . Doc , this finishes you and me for good and all . I 'm sorry . - Can you get up , son ? - I do n't know . - Can you make it to the horse ? - I think so . Did you see what that little horse did , pulling me out like that ? He 's a regular bird dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all right . Charlie , you better stay here and have a look around town . That kid 's got a bullet in him . He ai n't going far . Let 's go . Who 's that ? Quit that yelling . Get these horses out of sight . This is Billy the Kid . He got a bad one on the left side ... but the bullet did n't hit anything vital and it came out in the back . Do n't move him at all or the bleeding will start again . I guess you better cut his clothes off . Put a bandage on the wound and see that it 's always moist . Keep him warm and dry . If he gets a chill , he 's a goner . If he goes out of his head , tie him down . The neighbors hear him yelling , tell them your aunt has smallpox . That 'll keep them away . I guess that 's all . Now do your best for this boy . If I ca n't come back , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring you along . Shoo , shoo ! Face like a baby . He 's so hot . He 's no hotter than your brother Julio was . He 's soaking wet again . Get me some sheets , Aunt Guadalupe . Get them yourself . - What 's the matter with you ? - I would n't lift a finger for him . What 's the matter ? - Been lookin ' for him around here . - Well , ai n't that too bad . Chico , what 's the matter with you ? He smells the blood . He was just getting ready to peck his eyes out . You stay out of here . - Your name McDonald ? - What do you wan na know for ? Why do n't you wan na tell me ? - Yes , that 's my name . Why ? - Your father 's name is ... Woodruff . Charlie Woodruff . I used to work for him when he was Tom Motsacoro . Oh , yes . I guess I was a little girl then . - Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Very well . Thank you . You 're getting fat as a pig . - What are you doing up here ? - I 've been working with the sheriff . We 're looking for Billy the Kid . You get out of here ! - Come in and sit down . - Some other time . I 'll drop in the first chance I get . - What 's wrong with that bird ? - Nothing . I have a hen sitting under the bed and he likes to peck at her . - Want me to get him out of there ? - No . Everything 's all upset in there . We just got up . Good-bye . I 'm glad to have seen you . Same here . So long , Aunt Guadalupe . - I 'll walk down a ways with you . - No , you wo n't . Lunch is all ready . Good-bye . I 'll fix you . How 's Billy ? Looks like he 's having a chill . A chill ? Where are you ? Right here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 'm so cold . - I 'll get you warm . - Do n't go away . - I 'll only be a minute . How can you stop a thing like this ? - You 're mad at me . - No . - Yes , you are . - No , I 'm not . - Why do you hide from me ? - I 'll be right back . - Where 's that bottle of whiskey ? - I finished it . The time I had that bad cough . I fired those hot stones for Julio , but it was just the same . He shook like a leaf till he died . You get out of here and shut the door . What ? Just get out of here . Have you gone crazy ? You can bring the minister tomorrow if it 'll make you feel better about it . Now get out . You 're not gon na die . I 'll get you warm . Well , Red , you ca n't stand this pace much longer . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . None of my affair , but we crossed the county line ten minutes ago . That 's right , Swanson . It 's none of your affair . Break up ! Scatter for those rocks ! You look different today . You look better . Say , is that you ? What are you doing here ? I live here . Well , I 've been trying to figure this out . - How 'd I get here ? - Doc brought you . Oh . Are you Doc 's girl ? What do you know about that . Be careful your wound . You 'll hurt yourself . That 's right . I remember now . - I caught one yesterday , did n't I ? - Yesterday ? It was a month ago . You 've been terribly sick . A month ? That 's a long time . - How 's Red ? - Red ? - Have you been takin ' good care of him ? - Who 's Red ? Did n't Doc leave my horse here ? Well , I 'll swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Behind my back too . Is he all right again ? Say , who 's this old lollipop ? It 's my Aunt Guadalupe . ? Qu ? tal ? ? C ? mo est ? ? You have n't got a ham sandwich on you ? You hungry ? I do n't think we have anything cooked beside some beans . That 'll do for a starter , eh , lollipop ? Say , you do n't talk like a sick man . Who said I was ? What does that " lollipop " mean ? Oh , something sweet . Sweet ? Sweet , like candy . You know , dulce . Is that a fact ? Where are you going ? Oh , to see if I can find a fresh egg or two . - How do you feel ? - Fine . When do we eat ? - You just had lunch about an hour ago . - Honest ? Will you bring me my clothes ? I want to have a look around . What for ? I ca n't spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see if I can find my ring . Your ring ? Yeah . I had a ring on this finger and it 's gone . I 've been worried about it . You must n't be upset about a thing like that . You can get another one , ca n't you ? This one 's been kind of lucky for me . It belonged to a fellow who was supposed to have had a charmed life ... as long as he kept it on his finger . Then how did you get it ? Did you kill him ? No . Somebody else did that . Then the ring was n't so lucky for him after all , was it ? Well , nothing happened to him until he took it off to wash his hands . No , you better not get up till tomorrow . - You said that yesterday . - You 're not strong enough yet . Who says I 'm not ? Billy , you must n't . You 'll hurt yourself . Then why do n't you quit wrestling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not well enough . You 're not ... Rio ! Come on . I want you to go down to the store with me . I have some washing to do . You 've got all afternoon to do it . Come on . - I have to fix my hair first . - All right , hurry up then . - Why do you have to go with her ? - I better . What if somebody should come by ... like that deputy sheriff friend of yours the other day ? Yes , that 's right . I 'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe . - Who is it ? - It 's me , Doc . Hurry up ! Open this door here . Coming . Hello , Doc . Glad to see you , Doc ! You 'd never know it . I thought I 'd have to break the door down . It 's the rain , Doc . I could n't hear a thing , Doc . You do n't need to yell so loud . I 'm not deaf . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for four days ? It was lucky for me . The only way I could shake those bloodhounds . Washed out all your tracks , huh ? Hungry ? First sit down I 've had since I left here . How 's Billy ? Oh , he 's fine , sure . He 's been up almost a week now . Good . Where 's Rio ? So that 's what all the yellings about , eh ? - I 'll go and call her for you . - Wait a minute . You made enough noise now to raise the dead . So that 's it ? All right , where is he ? He 's getting dressed . Maybe I better give him a hand . No , Doc ! Please let me talk to you first ! What got into you ? Were you drunk ? What happened to you ? I do n't know . He 's a devil . He did the same to me . He can charm a bird right out of a bush . - I never saw it to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to say ... bless you , my children ? You might as well . Huh ? I 'm married to him . You 're what ? That 's the truth , Doc . Only please do n't tell him . Tell who ? Billy . - You mean he does n't know it ? - No . Then how could you be married to him ? He was out of his mind . I never would have done it , only I thought he was gon na die . And so he would have , if it had n't been for you . I do n't want his gratitude . Guess I should 've stayed out in the rain with the sheriff . - Make me a cup of coffee . - Sure . It 's a good thing you do n't want his gratitude . Why do you say that ? You know , when I come to think of it ... after what you done to me , I could n't wish you anything better ... than you hooking up with Billy . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . Hello , Doc . Is that all you got to say to me ? Now look here , Doc , I 'm sorry , but it 's your own fault . Oh , my fault , huh ? Who brought me here ? Now you want to switch the blame on me . First you take my horse , then my girl ... and both times it 's all my fault . That reminds me of something else . You ran away with Red , did n't you ? You think that 's any excuse ? It was good enough for me . - There 's only one trouble with it . - What 's that ? The horse was mine too . I was n't in much shape to argue that with you , was I ? No , I guess you were n't . But you did n't have use for that horse lying flat on your back , or did you ? All right , Doc , if that 's your way of looking at it . You just took the loan of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , that 's what I 'd like to know . You borrow from me ... I borrow from you . What does that mean ? Let 's have a cup of java . We better be getting out of here . Not at those prices . All right , Doc , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . What 's that ? Well , just to show you my heart 's in the right place ... I 'll let you take your pick . Huh ? You mean you 'd trade me for a horse ? It 's up to Doc . After all , I 've got to think of the other fellow , you know . I appreciate that . I sure do . Billy , you do n't mean that . And after all she did for you . Say , you should have seen what that little horse did for me , huh , Doc ? That 's right . I hope you wo n't think too hard of me ... but under the circumstances ... I 'm going to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied ? Listen , Doc , I like that little horse . What 'd I tell you , huh ? - I still ca n't believe it . - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . - What 's eating you ? Nothing ! Here . Fill these with fresh water . The creeks are muddy as all get out . How about grub ? Can you spare enough flour and bacon to get us to Fort Sumner ? Sure . Hey , it 's clearing up . We better be getting out of here . Lend me some dough , will you ? How much do you want ? About 50 bucks . Here 's 40 . Here . Buy yourself a horse and buggy . Do n't you think it 's too much ? You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20 if you want . If we get located in Fort Sumner , I 'll send for you . What for ? I ca n't stand ranch cooking . Here you are . - Thanks . Good-bye . - Bye , Doc . Bye , lollipop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same . Fill these up for Doc . Hello , you old hay bag . Have ya missed me ? He 's thin as a rail . He 's been getting a little exercise . Where 'd you get that plug ? Wore out the black horse I had , so I traded him to sheep herder for this one . He 's all right . Little wild yet . Come on . Ai n't Red a sweetheart ? I 'm going to let you have a loan of him for a little while . - Until you get your strength back . - You 're not gon na do me any favors . - What 's the matter with you ? - I do n't wan na be obligated about Red . - Why not ? - I 'm not giving up on getting him back ... anymore than I 've given up getting on this ornery goat . Bye , Rio . - What 's the matter ? - Boy , am I tuckered . - What are you lookin ' for ? - A sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't cotton to ? - I guess I forgot . - Yeah , it 's a bad habit you got . - What ? - Forgettin ' what belongs to others . - You think I did it on purpose ? - Yes . - Listen , I do n't feel good as it is . - Neither do I . You wan na make something out of it ? - That 's a big advantage you 're taking . - I ca n't help it . I 'm so plumb beat out , I 'll be lucky if I can draw ' em clear . I do n't want to crowd a sick man . I 'm all right . Just give me 40 winks and I 'll take ya with both hands free . I guess this is as good a place as any to make camp . There 's no water . And you wo n't find any between here and Fort Sumner . That 's a long ways off . When we get there our friend , the sheriff , wo n't be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's him ? I can tell him farther off than that . He would n't be coming after the two of us alone . Maybe he 's lost too many of his friends . How come you did n't knock him over ? Or did you try ? - Did I ? - That 's what I said . Did ya ? Did n't do nothin ' else . Who do you suppose put him on our trail ? Well , maybe somebody saw us pulling out or ... Or what ? Nothing . - Sure , she was the one . - Yeah , Rio . Why do you suppose she had to up and do a thing like that ? Well , women are funny . Go easy on that water . We 've only got two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner . What 's the matter ? Look ! Sweet spirited miter . The little darling put sand in it instead of water . That sure is one for the book . Well , no use hanging ' round here till morning . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll have another drink . What are you talking about ? You did n't have one in the first place . No , but I had the same notion about an hour ago . I know what you 're thinking , but it wo n't do you any good . - Take my advice . - What ? Killing a woman . - Why not ? - They 're all alike . There is n't anything they would n't do for you ... or to you . Hey , why did n't you wake me up ? We should 've gotten started long ago . Keep ' em up ! Hello , Pat . - Where 's Billy ? - Looks like he left ya . And on my horse , eh ? Try those on . You know me . Do I have to put these on ? I know ya . Put ' em on ! That was pretty smart , putting sand in those canteens . I had to give you something for your money , did n't I ? Oh , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? No wonder he came alone . All he had to do was take his time and wait for the sun to finish us off . Then how did you get back ? It was pretty tough ... but the more I thought about seeing you , darling ... the easier it got . Then what are you waiting for ? Go ahead . Say , that sounds real nice . I like to hear you ask for it . Keep it up . Beg some more . What would you like me to say ? Well , you might say " please " very sweetly . Please . Will you keep your eyes open ? Yes . Will you look right at me while I do it ? What is it ? Everybody drinks but me . I 'm supposed to be a camel , huh ? You want a drink , you can climb down and get it . Say , did you hear something ? - What kind of a track is that ? - I do n't know . Too small for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , take a look at that . Yeah , it 's an old Indian trick soaking rawhide in water to make it shrink . Another hour , she 'd have been hanging by her wrists . Well , I 'll say one thing for Billy . He sure does pay off poetic . He put her right where she could see the water . He just left here less than half an hour ago . He went that way , toward those mountains . - Are you all right ? Sit . - Do n't worry about me . Go after him . - We ca n't catch him now . - Why not ? He 's got too much of a head start on us . Sit down . You know , I think he 's in love with you . What are you talking about ? The crazier a man is about a woman , the crazier he thinks and does . He 's only crazy about one thing : Himself . Say , that gives me a thought . Maybe we 'll get Mr . Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . If he 's crazy enough to do you like this ... maybe he 's just crazy enough to come back to turn you loose . You 're the one that 's crazy . He does n't care anything about me . He 'd never come back . Maybe so , but it 's worth trying . Ai n't it , Doc ? If he 's fool enough to come back , he ought a get himself caught . I told you not to breathe so loud . All right , all right . Well , how do you like it ? I thought I tied it tighter than that . - You came back . - Not on your account , I didn't . - You did n't ? - You see Doc and the sheriff ? Here we are , Billy , right behind ya . Now put those hands where they belong . Say , why did n't you tip me off ? Hurry up with that grub . I wan na get to town before dark . - Well , I 've only got two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ? - I 'll use one on you in a minute . - I would n't put it past ya . Now 's your chance with me all trussed up like a chicken . Here we are together again . Same old happy family . Yeah , and I 'd have been halfway to Fort Sumner if it had n't been for you . - Me ? - Yeah , you . Give me a cigarette . - You mean her . - Rio ! Are you out of your mind ? - Come out and admit it like a man . - Admit what ? You did n't know Pat caught me until you got back to our camp , did ya ? - Then why come after us ? - Why not ? We 'd have been clear to Lincoln before you even got back here . Say , mister , what are you trying to make out ? I heard you say once you did n't like ranch cooking ... so I guess you figured you 'd better come back and get Rio . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get her . - You did . - I tell you I didn't . - Actions speak louder than words . - Do they ? I 'll show you how much I care about her . If you want her back , you can have her . Now what do you think about that ? I do n't want her . - Cattle do n't graze after sheep . - Sheep ? Sheep did you say ? I did n't say goats or monkeys . Why you . Ah , sit down . - What 's the matter with you ? - None of your business ! Careful , young fella . You want it now ? I 've just been waitin ' for an excuse like this . I 'll fix you up . Never mind fixing ' any more food . We 're leavin ' now . Come on . Let me get a drink first . All right , hurry up . Hey , Rio , come here and hold my hands so I wo n't fall in . Come out of there ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking us back to Lincoln , ai n't ya ? Where did ya think I was takin ' ya ? - It 's over that way , ai n't it ? - Sure . What are you gettin ' at ? Take a look . Hey , Doc . Well , the Mescaleros are out early this year . They 're talkin ' about us , ai n't they ? Yeah . They 're tipping ' off another hunting party that must be out . Right over there . On both sides of us . I guess our best chance is to hightail it to Fort Sumner . Do n't figure on me doing much hightailing . - Why not ? - I ai n't no acrobat . I hope you fellas have sense enough to behave yourselves . Sure , Pat , certainly . Sure , Pat . No , ya do n't ! - That 's your horse over there . - Who says so ? I say so . Get on him and hurry up . Rio , you ride the paint . Thanks . Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm gon na ride him . I do n't like this . Looks like some of those Mescaleros are ahead of us too . No , you better not come over here , Rio . - Why not ? - They put the fire on them . Those Mescaleros sure do play for keeps . Say , what 's that ? It 's a good size party . We 'll be knee-deep in them in a minute . Look over there too . - Hey , what are ya doin ' ? - What do ya think ? I want my gun . Now wait a minute . You 're not gon na argue at a time like this . Are n't you gon na give us a chance ? He 'd like to see them put the fire on me . - I sure would . - What about her ? We ca n't talk about it now . I want to know one thing . Do I have your solemn promise that you 'll give them back when I ask ? - Sure . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that he does ? Who 's gon na see to it that I do ? I 'll take your word for it . - Where are my cartridges ? - Here you are . Now what do we do ? Make a stand or run for it ? - Ca n't make a stand here . - I know something that might work . - What is it ? - Come on . Do exactly what I do . Cut him loose ! I know this place . We 're about 40 miles from Fort Sumner . Senor Garrett , what are you doing out this late ? Hello , Pablo . Can you put us up for the night ? Sure , glad to have you . Come right in . My house is yours . I 'll take care of the horses . Well , boys , I guess we 're out of the woods now , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . I would n't be too sure of that , Pat . Oh , yes , he 's right , Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is very important . I want you to ride to Fort Sumner ... and give this note to the town marshal . Did he say " town marshal " ? That 's what it sounded like to me . Thanks , Rio . It certainly is a beautiful night out . I think I 'll take a little stroll . And , gentlemen , just in case I should n't return before you retire ... I 'll say good night now . I think I 'll go with ya . Well , Billy , you 've been pretty good to my little horse . I guess the least I can do is let you say good-bye to him . That 's awfully nice of you , Doc . Oh , I always like to think of the other fella . So if you just stand right here in this doorway ... and do n't make no warlike moves ... then you can wave farewell to ' I'm as we ride off . In other words , you think you 're gon na leave . I 'm sorry , Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is . - Listen , Doc . - You 're wasting your time , Pat . Have n't you forgotten something ? No , I do n't think so . Good night all . Say , Doc . Yes , what is it ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to listen to me for a minute . Why ? What if I do n't feel like waving good-bye to Red ? You still think you got something to say about that horse , eh ? Yes , I do . All right , go ahead and say it . That 's a pretty big advantage to give a man like you . Did n't you tell me that once ? How 's this ? You do n't have to go that far . Thanks . What about him ? Will he leave us alone ? Or do you think we ought to pull his teeth before we start ? Do n't worry about me . I would n't lift a finger , Doc , to keep you from killing him . You and me never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . All right , son , I 'm waiting . Put those plates down . You 're makin ' me nervous . - Billy , he 'll kill ya . - What do you care ? - But you can get another horse . - I want this one . Why ? I wan na see if I can teach him to make smoke come out of his ears . Say , I have n't got all night . Get back against that wall . - But Billy ... - Go on ! And count up to three . I wo n't . You 're outta your mind , both of ya . How about you , Pat ? Sure , I 'll be glad to . You 're too willing . I do n't trust you . I think I 'd rather have that cuckoo clock do the counting for me . Yeah , that 's good enough . It 's gon na strike in a minute . Should we pull on the last cuckoo ? All right . Well , Billy , I guess this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Have you ever seen two kids wrestling in the yard ? They push and tussle and maybe they look like they 're fighting ... but they 're not . They 're really friends ... and everything 's in fun . Then pretty soon , they play a little too rough ... one of ' em gets mad ... and in the end , somebody always gets hurt . So for you and me , this is where somebody gets hurt . But when it 's over ... and however it turns out , son ... no hard feelings . Why did n't you draw ? Why did you change your mind ? This some trick of yours ? No , I just do n't feel like it .

He never had cold feet in his life . What is it , Billy ? I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock was n't so good . Why ? Well , it gave me time to think and remember a few things . You 're the only partner I ever had . Gosh , do you really feel that way , son ? - I treated you worse than anyone . - Nah , it was all my fault . - Would n't want Red carrying both of us . - Oh , do n't worry .

Do n't take any wooden nickels . You 're not going with him . Look here , you ai n't gon na start something with the two of us , are ya ? I might 've known you 'd do this to me . Ever since you met him , you 've treated me like a dog . The very first day , you sided with him against me ... and made me the laughingstock of the town ! Take it easy .

Clear ? Pat , you 're just getting yourself all steamed up . I 'll be seeing you one of these days , and we 'll have a good laugh about this . Now , so long . Be careful .

If I had n't come between ya , none of this would 've happened . It sure is funny ... how two or three trails can cross ... and get all tangled up . Well , go ahead . After you . Say , you do n't think I 'd shoot you in the back , do you ? I do n't know , but I ai n't gon na tempt ya . I do n't think you 'd be fool enough to try to do it from the front .

I thought you might like to have Doc 's guns as a keepsake . Say , I sure would . Thanks , Pat . Thanks a whole lot . I never had an extra pair . Black holsters too . They 'd go nice with Sunday clothes , if I ever get any . Do you think they 'll suit ya ? If the barrels ai n't too long . No , they 're just the same . Be careful . They 're loaded . That 's right .

All your troubles would be buried ... past and present . You and Rio could go off with nothing to worry about . How come you 'd do a favor like that for me ? There you go again , Billy . Distrustin ' a person who 's tryin ' to be decent to you . Do n't you realize that 's your whole trouble ? Do n't you see that 's what 's gotten you into all your fights ?

I 've been pretty patient with you . Billy , my son ... it 's your duty to give them up . You owe it to yourself . You ought to start a new life today . Those guns are the badge of your shame . They represent everything you must leave behind you . Do n't you realize that ? Do n't you understand ... that if you 're going to start all over again ... your hands must be clean ?

They must 've gotten mixed up while I was playin ' with ' em . Thanks . I left my guns right there . What for ? Do n't you have to show them to everybody to make them believe your story ?

I thought you did n't know where she was . I did n't . She came to me a few days ago . To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me . She thought you might lighten that burden .

What does she do with herself after business hours ? It 's always seemed to me that she was sort of lonely and unhappy . Well , Mary , I guess most people are . There , that 's it . In the old days , this would 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like to do your hair . Thank you . Do you know what this is , Frances ? Why , I ought to . Mrs . Redi 's new trademark . Of course , I should 've known . This figure 's been puzzling me . Hello , Mary . It 's nice to see you . No news of Jacqueline ? - I 'm afraid not . Well , that 's too bad . What did she want ? Nothing . I just did her hair . What were you talking about ? Nothing . Nothing ? Why , that 's absurd . I heard you laughing and talking . She was asking questions . Oh , well , she was asking about you . Whether it was nice to work for you or not . And that was all ? Well , she asked about the trademark . What did she want to know ? - She showed me a drawing . Oh , you fool . Why , that symbol is us . Us . She was asking about us . Mary ? - Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be out in a minute . That wo n't be necessary . I have n't much to say . If I were you , Mary , I 'd go back to school . I 'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline . I ca n't give up looking for her , Mrs . Redi . No matter what you 're hinting at . I have no intention whatsoever of hinting . Your sister , Mary , is a murderess . She killed Irving August . Stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding . I do n't believe you . I had to help get rid of the body . You saw it on the subway . And I warn you , Mary , go back . You do n't know what you 're doing or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister . You go back to school . I 'm sorry to be late , Natalie . We have n't begun tea yet . Hello , Frances . - Hello , Mrs . Redi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't you pour ? I 'm sorry , I 'm nervous . This is very trying for me . - I know . You introduced Jacqueline to us . But how could you tell ? - I should 've known . She had no sincerity , no real belief . Miss Rowan , do you take cream ? Please , Natalie , would you mind pouring ? You should n't be nervous . There 's nothing personal or vengeful in what we are about to do . We have only to make a decision . But it can be such a horrible decision because we 're all pledged to nonviolence . Now , this ... - Our founder must have known when he wrote these seemingly contradictory rules . The rule of nonviolence and the law that whoever betrays us must die . He must have known . - But I do n't understand it . Some of us , Frances , must believe without understanding . Yes , I suppose so . I went back through the history last night . I read about Johann Rozenquartz . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fully , Mrs . Redi . " We will avoid violence . For once undertaken , violence can become its own master and lead to either good or evil . " - But he also wrote ... I can quote that too . " Those who go out into the marketplaces and speak of us and give knowledge of our being and our deeds whomsoever doeth this shall die . " I 'm puzzled . Since our order was founded six betrayals have been listed . And six deaths as punishment . And now there 's Jacqueline . - Oh , but ... But you ca n't do anything to her . You must n't hurt her . But she betrayed us , Frances . - She did n't betray us . She was only going to a doctor . A psychiatrist . She told him , Frances . She told him about us . I know this is difficult for you . I know that you love her . - But she did n't betray us . Even if I believed that , I would still consider her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving August 's death . Without consulting me , Mrs . Redi was ill-advised enough to have the body removed by Leo and Durk . This makes us all a party to the crime . What if there 's a trial ? What if Jacqueline is asked about the removal of the body ? Do you think , Frances , that she will keep silent ? It is a real danger and one which forces our decision . And Jacqueline 's sister ? - I 've taken care of Mary . I 've spoken to her , and she 's going back to school . Good . Then it is decided . Leo and Durk and I will complete our plans . Mary . This is wonderful , your coming here so unexpectedly . It 's almost like a wish come true . I want to show you my room . I want you to see all of it . But it 's a small room , Jason . It 's grown big with the years . And my window , through which I see the world . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not a searchlight . It 's a sword blade , cutting the blue cloak of a prince . Not stars ... - Jason . I 'm going back to Highcliffe . I 've come to say goodbye . But I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me ... Well , that it was your advent into my world . It turns out to be goodbye . Why ? Please do n't make me tell you , Jason . I thought I was your friend , Mary . Just goodbye is n't enough for a friend . I had begun to write again . That 's what I was doing when you came in . It 's because of Jacqueline . I ca n't go on looking for her . You went to see Mrs . Redi . She told you something . What was it ? Jacqueline 's a murderess . She killed a man . You believe that ? - I have to . It was Irving August . Everything Mrs . Redi said , it fits in with what I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subway . But if it 's true , then there 's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline . And Gregory , he loves her . He loves you , Mary . You 'll have to tell him . He 's Jacqueline 's husband . I ca n't . But you 've got to tell him , Mary . Even if only for the practical reason that he 's a lawyer and will know what to do . I 'm going to phone him . Well , she 's got to be found . That 's the first step . She 's got to be found so she can give herself up to the police . But we 've tried so long to find her . Judd could tell us , if he would . Do you think he knows about this ? - I do n't know . Well , he 's clever , and he 's cautious in his way . I think if he knew he 'd advise her to do what I want . Surrender herself to the police and stand trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him . Could you find him ? - I suppose so . I guess I could pick him up somewhere . Jason I sometimes wonder . You 're so sweet to me . So kind and sympathetic . I do n't know how I can ever thank you . Thank me ? You do n't have to thank me . What 's that ? - Verse . Verse I wrote . Do n't bother going up . I can do this all night , Jason . Watch . Following me to find Jacqueline ? Well , it wo n't work . Love and understanding wo n't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet . Actually , there are two favors I want to ask . One as a poet , one as a detective . Sounds strange . I 'm going to be very wary . Some time ago , you spoke about my writing again . I want your help . I 'd like you to bring this to your publisher . This is curious , Jason . Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden humility . I should like people to read what I have written . I hope it 'll find as much favor as your other book . But somehow I doubt it . The time is out of tune . Why not let your publisher judge that ? Wait . There 's that other favor . I 'd forgotten . - Tell me where Jacqueline is . We 've got to find her . - You do n't expect me to do that , do you ? Yes , when I tell you . - Tell me what ? You 'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is when I tell you she 's a murderess . She killed a man . Tell me , why this sudden desire to publish ? To awaken like Byron and find yourself famous ? I think it 's time . - No other reason ? No woman ? Not the little Miss Gibson ? Perhaps . Wait a minute . I 'll call her . Jacqueline , this is Judd . Jacqueline . Who is it ? - Judd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Mary . Jacqueline . It 's all right . You 're safe . Nothing 's going to hurt you . Your husband seems very certain of that . - Yes . I 'm very certain there 's only one way to help you , Jacqueline to protect you . You 've got to come with us . Let me do all I can as a lawyer to straighten out Irving August 's death . You must come with us , darling . Let us help you . For me , this seems to be the end of a delightful relationship . Here . This will put some life into you . It 's like coming back to life . It would be much easier , Jacqueline , if you told me exactly what happened . I 'd know what to do for you . Please , Jacqueline . You know about the Palladists . You know who they are what they are . I was one of them . Jacqueline was always a sensationalist trying to seize onto something . Anything to bring her happiness . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It appealed to her . I was n't happy with them . I wanted to break away . I was miserable . I went to Louis for help . They felt that I 'd betrayed them . They wanted me to die . Kill myself . They kept me locked up at La Sagesse . I was there such a long time . Imagine the effect of such imprisonment on Jacqueline . I was terrified . The darkness in the corners of the room all the little noises . Then one night the door opened . A man came in . Tiptoeing in . I had a scissors in my hand . I struck at him . Do n't . We know what happened . Do n't go on . Any court in the land would understand . We 'll wait a few days , let you rest , then we 'll go to the police . Why ca n't Jacqueline stay here with me for a few days ? You 'd like that , would n't you ? There 's my old friend . The searchlight ? Cyrano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it . I like it . I 've always loved the story . A man knowing he could n't have the woman he loved and wooing her for his friend . We 're friends , are n't we , Gregory ? It 's been a hard evening for both of you . Perhaps you ought to take Jacqueline to your room , Mary . Good night , Jacqueline . Good night , Mary . - Good night . This is no time to play Cyrano . What was in your mind ? I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline . To let her know . - To let her know what ? That you love Mary . She 'll have to know sometime . Not from me . Not from Mary . Goodbye , darling . I 'll only be gone until 3 . Bye . - lf you get lonely go down and see Mrs . Romari . I told her you were staying with me . I wo n't be lonely . Yes , this is Mary . But she could n't have gone out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with , or Mr . Ward ? Two men ? No . I 'll get home as soon as I can , Mr . Romari . The acceptance of a secret is an obligation . In this case , the obligation carried the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret . You understand that , do n't you ? Yes . I understand it . Then you also understand that you must die . No . You 've spoken so often of ending it all . I ca n't understand why this should be so difficult for you . You have only to drink a little . - Yes , Jacqueline . You were always talking suicide , of ending your life when you wanted to . Yes . When I wanted to . - It does n't matter . You want to now . You should want to . It is your obligation , your duty . You have only to stretch out your hand , take up the glass and drink a little . It wo n't hurt . No , no , no . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have enough courage to hear what I 've kept from you all these years . That girl you loved that other patient of mine ... She did n't disappear . She 's in an asylum . A horrible , raving thing . I never wanted you to know . And all the while you 've been my friend . Please may I have a drink of water ? I 'm very thirsty . Drink . No . There will be no water , and there 'll be no rest . You may as well drink . No , no ! If you like , I 'll go with you to dinner . I 'd like that . - Jason . I ca n't find Gregory . I 've been trying to find him . What 's wrong , Mary ? Jacqueline . Mr . Romari phoned me . She went out this afternoon with two men he 'd never seen before . They may have been friends of hers . - No . She would n't go with anyone unless compelled . These months of hiding have made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What ? They may have found her . Would they hurt her ? I do n't know . You 'd better go up to your room and wait for us , Mary . Go ahead , Jacqueline . Go ahead . It is late . Drink it , Jacqueline . There 's nothing else for you to do . They say you 've got to die . Drink it , Jacqueline ! You 've got to ! I ca n't stand this ! No . No , I ca n't let you die ! The only time I was ever happy was when I was working with you . You were always so good to me . You may go now , Jacqueline . The decision was against violence , but there 'll be another decision . Today , tomorrow we 'll find you , but now you may go . I told you you could go . Please help me . There 's a man following me . I should n't wonder , babe . - I 'm serious . Help me . I 'll help you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come along . Who are you ? I 'm Mimi . I 'm dying . - No . Yes . I 've been quiet . Oh , ever so quiet . I hardly move . And yet it keeps coming all the time , closer and closer . And I rest and I rest and still I 'm dying . And you do n't wan na die ? I 've always wanted to die . Always . - I 'm afraid . And I 'm tired of being afraid . Of waiting . Why wait ? - I 'm not going to wait . I 'm going out , and I 'm going to laugh and dance and do all the things I used to do . - And then ? I do n't know . You will die . Now that you 've hounded and worried her you do n't even know where she is . At least tell me , has she been here ? Yes . She left here an hour ago . She may even be home by now . Why do n't you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lovers of evil . It 's a joke . Pathetic little joke . We have n't asked your opinion . I propose to give it to you anyway . You 're a poor , wretched group of people who have taken the wrong turning . Wrong ? Who knows what is wrong or right ? If I prefer to believe in satanic majesty and power , who can deny me ? What proof could you bring that good is superior to evil ? It 's hard to put into words , but you 're wrong . One proof . I 'll prove you wrong . This afternoon Jason and I were talking together and I remembered certain phrases from childhood . Simple half-forgotten words . It was the Lord 's Prayer . I 'm a physician yet not I nor any of my colleagues , no matter how learned have ever found a substitute for those words as a rule for human relationship . You might remember them . Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us . There 's a sentence for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation , but deliver us from evil . All right , thank you very much . That was Dr . Judd , Mary . He phoned to say Jacqueline 's on her way here . Gregory . - Yes ? You better take Jacqueline with you tonight . That 's what I should have done yesterday . I 'll take her away someplace where she can rest . Mary . No , stay nearby . I want to talk to you . I love you . You know that . - Yes . I 've never loved anyone before , Gregory . And I do love you . You must know that . But Jacqueline 's my sister whom I 'd lost and found again . I know . I should n't have told you . - No , I 'm glad . At least I 've heard you say it . I run to death and death meets me as fast . And all my pleasures are like yesterday .

He might be the man who calls you " Friend , " who visits frequently at your home . He might even be someone who comes often to my own home . And while I pride myself on being an amateur detective , Even I might easily be fooled . And yet , his day of reckoning must come . He is tormented by fear ... That someday he will make one false move , one slip , That will betray him . And when he does , the lightning Of justice will strike ... the unsuspected . Victor 's the only man I know . That can turn my blood to ice water . Let 's have another drink . We could all be Murderers ! Check the glasses , Kent , and open up some more wine . Some more wine . Hello , Mary . Oh , professor ! Dr . Edelman , I 'm so glad you could come . It 's thrilling having a psychiatrist here . It 's very difficult to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open up all our secret doors . What 's hidden behind yours , Althea ? Ghosts ? No , Mr . Donovan . There 's nothing a ghost could do for me . Let me know when Mr . Grandison gets here , will you , please ? Yes , miss . Uh , do n't drink too much . Oh , excuse me . Louder and gayer , Lover ! * I like your style * * Say , I think it 's marvelous * Good evening , sir . Good evening . Excuse me , madam . There 's a gentleman ... Oh , thank you . Pardon me , lover . It 's the most thrilling party ! Having fun ? Oh , yes ! Good evening . I'm-Yes , I know . You 're Victor Grandison 's niece , Mrs . Oliver Keane . Althea . My name is Howard- Steven Howard . I have some bags in the cab . Bags , sir ? But , uh - yes , sir . You brought luggage ? Do you plan to stay ? Obviously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want to see Mr . Grandison about ? Quite a large party , is n't it ? Would you care to meet anyone ? No . Not very appetizing . It 's Victor 's birthday . Once a year , his friends crawl out of the woodwork . This year , it 's a surprise party . Will he be surprised to see you ? I like matches . You never have to refill them . And when you 're through with them , you simply throw them away ... Like people . Why has n't Victor asked you here before ? Probably because we 've never met . He 's not expecting you ? You 're a very curious woman , are n't you , Mrs . Keane ? You are going to tell me . Maybe . What will you trade ? A drink ? Brandy . Thank you . You glued to this spot ? Home is where the heart is . Very amusing . You 're drinking too much , as usual . How much , my love , is too much ? Regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind lose its razor edge ? Do I slur my words ? Do I forget anything ? Not a single , solitary thing of all the things I 'd give so much to forget . No , I 'm still conscious . Therefore , my sweet , far from having had too much , I 've not had enough yet . The least you could do is stay sober . While we have guests in the house . I 'd then be free to dwell on our sacred marriage vows , Which you , my love , hold in such light esteem . Oliver , you talk too much . I 'll be quiet . I 'll just sit and bask in cowardly splendor . " Thus , conscience doth make cowards of us all . " Here . Thank you . You seem interested . Fascinated . You know , it 's very much like Mateo in his middle period . Who painted it ? My husband , in his sober period ... Before he married me . It 's lovely . It 's so alive . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the freighter that was burned at sea last month . And Victor 's secretary committed suicide last week . There 's no connection . I did n't say there was . She was beautiful . She drank too much milk and her seams were always straight . You did n't like her . Frankly , she bored me . She was sweet , shy , unforgettable . I can understand why you did n't like her . You knew Matilda ? I was married to her . Do n't drop that . Now you know what I 'm doing here ... And I 've earned this . Oh ... That 's impossible . Is it ? She was in love with-With your husband Oliver . She told me-that and other things ... That you married him just a few days before she was supposed to . I know quite a lot about you , Althea ... Quite a lot . Man : Quiet , everybody . Here he comes now . Surprise ! Who thought up this torture ? Oh , Victor , dear , you are surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did remember your birthday . My dear , I 've been trying to Forget it for the last 20 years . Happy returns ! Oh , Victor ! Happy birthday , Victor . There 's the lord of the manor now . This will be quite A surprise party for Victor when he discovers you and Matilda were married . I 'll tell him myself ... Later . And deny me that pleasure ? I doubt if you deny Yourself many things . I generally get what I want . Good evening , miss Moynihan . Good evening . Oh , look at them . A cork pops for free , and they all swarm like locusts . We thought you were n't coming , Jane . Oh , I generally get places ... After driving Victor there and parking his car , and-Well , you see , I 'm all things to victor ... Except a woman . Why , Donovan , I 'm delighted to see you , and surprised . You look like a fish out of water . You were the bait . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy birthday , my darling ! My dear , this is all very lovely , But why a party at a time like this ? This is like dancing on their graves . Oh , I 'm sorry , Victor . I thought it might help you forget . Well , will you do something for me ? Take that pianist out and have him shot . All right . Happy birthday ! Now , what 's this ? Sweets , to coin a phrase , for the sweet . My dear , it 's a monstrosity . Why , it 's just a plain birthday cake-Not even a hidden sword . Come on , Make a wish . Yeah , Make a wish ! Thinking of stealing it ? Why not something more practical ? I , uh , I was curious about the chandelier . You 're not the first to be curious about that chandelier . It was Mr . Grandison 's secretary who was found hanging from it . And then the police evinced great interest when they cut her down . I read the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandison . More , I imagine , to the young woman . But then , of course , no smart girl would be found . Hanging around a Bachelor 's private study . I can get along without any humorous remarks . Will you please get out ? I beg your pardon ? I said , please get out . Surely . Hope to see you before your next birthday . No more birthdays . Grand party , Victor . Had a wonderful time . I had a good time myself , thank you . Oh , Jane , wo n't you stay the night ? I want to begin work early in the morning . Good night , Victor . Sleep in the country with the frogs chirping or whatever they do ? No , thanks , darling . I 'm going back to civilization . Goodbye . Good luck . Good night . Give my love to that small daughter of yours . Ok . Thank you . The nicest thing about guests is their departure . Arrivederci ! Oh , listen , you 're not going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it here , but are n't you tired ? Tired ? After a social evening , Nothing cheers me up as much as a nice , gory murder . Come on , let 's see what you got . Right in there . I 'm perfectly all right . Perfectly All right . Yes , sir . Put him to bed . To bed . Yes , madam . Be gentle with me , Kent . When I 'm in this condition , I tip over very easily . Very easily . Yes , sir . Hmm . Let 's go inside . Coming . Let me see ... This was a hatchet murder , was n't it ? That 's right . Tiny little thing , Is n't she ? Well , there 's only half of her there . Yeah . Who 's this ? That 's the murderer . This good-looking young boy ? Criminals do n't run true to type , Victor . You know that . The most dangerous of all is some charming young killer . That no one will ever suspect- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor . Victor , there 's something I think you ought to know . Oh , I know . I saw Oliver . I can only suggest that you keep him away from any open flame . It is n't Oliver . Have you noticed a young man around here with very bad manners ? I think you 'll find him in your study . In my study ? Good evening , Mr . Grandison . Were you looking for me ? Hello , sir . Are you a late guest for the party . Or an early arrival for breakfast ? Neither . This is Mr . Howard , Victor . I 'm delighted to meet you , Mr . Howard . Now , if you do n't mind , Mr . Donovan and I have things to talk about . Victor , I think you ought to talk to Mr . Howard . He and Matilda were married . Married ? You and Matilda were married ? To each other . Really ? When ? 3 days before the accident . I see . Oh , please sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , do n't go . I 'd rather you stayed . This is Mr . Donovan . We 've met . Casually . Do sit down . You have proof Of what you say ? Of course . You sound suspicious . Merely concerned . Matilda was very dear to us . And to me , too , but I hardly expected this kind of welcome . Well , I ... We ca n't help being curious . At this sudden appearance ... Just as Matilda 's estate is to be legally settled . So you think I want Matilda 's money . It 's a rather large sum-Runs into millions , as you undoubtedly know . That 's the one thing I did n't know . We met , and a few days later , we were married . I had to leave for Lisbon . Matilda was to follow by boat . When I learned the boat had gone down , I came back . You see , I thought I could find something here . That would make not having her ... A little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all I want . I 'm not interested in the money . I happen to have money of my own . Quite a bit of money . How lovely . I 'm afraid I 've been in error , sir . You shall have the picture ... And with it , our most heartfelt welcome . I loved Matilda , and anyone she loves would necessarily be very close to me . So you will stay with us tonight ? If I may . Of course you may . We 'll talk some more tomorrow . Will you make him comfortable , my dear ? Yes , I will . I 'll take him to the guesthouse . Fine . Good night . Good night . Good night , sir . I hope you like it . It 's decorated in Early American . Do you like Early American ? Extraordinary , most extraordinary ... But do you know I do n't believe a word he said ? Sounded too much like the truth to be true . Might be interesting to know a good deal more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I 've discovered that everything worthwhile costs a little money . Good night , Victor . Good night . It 's been a very interesting evening . Mm-hmm . Yes , well ... Victor : " It is difficult now " to pierce the mists of time that obscure what Charles Woodward was thinking when he struck his light of love that fateful blow , but if we may conjecture , it is not too much to assume that his thoughts may have turned back to that lovely Spring day when first they met , " and their adolescent passion flared into its brief breing . " Being , being , being ! Silly word . Silly script . Turn it off , Jane . Want to hear it played back ? No , thank you . I 'll listen to it later . It 's much too nice a day for murder . What 's wrong , Victor ? You 've lost all your zip . You 're as limp as an old girdle . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As though something were going to happen-Something unpleasant . I had that feeling once , but I married him anyway . Here , run your pretty blue eyes over next week 's material . You know , it 's a sort of throbbing in the air ... A feeling of inevitability , like ... Like , uh ... Falling in love-a vibration . You probably would n't remember . I 'll have you know I 've vibrated in my time . Once , In Kansas City , I-Oh , well , no use living in the past ... But for 6 months , I vibrated like a musical saw . I beg your pardon , sir . Mr . Donovan , sir ... Huh ? He 's in the library , sir . Oh , good . That 'll be all , Jane . Hi , Donovan . I 'm delighted to see you . I 've been waiting impatiently for you . Will you sit down ? Of course . Jane ... I 'll go quietly , only this shoe is choking me . Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on except his name . Steven Francis Howard . Born April 12 , 1913 . His father was Francis J . Howard . Does that suggest anything to you ? Oil . Yes , quite a lot of oil . Mr . Howard is well-equipped . With pin money , just as he said . 31/2 years in the army- He 's a captain-Wounded twice , discharged early in May at fort Dixon . Went straight to New York , where he stayed at the Sherry Central . Same time Matilda was there . A week later , he went to Lisbon . His story checks all along the line , Victor . Cablegram . I 'll take it . It 's for Mr . Grandison . I 'm Mr . Grandison . You want me to check on anything else , let me know . Thank you very much , and goodbye . Goodbye , Victor . I 'm sorry . I love it . Mercury on a bicycle just brought this . Oh . Hmm . " Are n't you going to open It ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-Oh , yeah . Yeah , I was thinking of something else . Uh ... Do you , uh , happen to know where Mr . Howard is ? No , but Althea usually keeps in touch with him , And the last I saw of her , she was headed to the guesthouse ... Vibrating . Does it always take you so long to make a move ? I like to be perfectly sure of what I 'm doing . Were you sure when you married Matilda ? I was . She was n't . Oh . How interesting . How long were you married ? I do n't suppose you could call it a marriage . There was a wedding ceremony . I had to leave the same day . That 's why you think you love her-You have n't been disillusioned . Speaking from experience ? You 've met Oliver . I beg your pardon . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Oh , no , Victor . We 've been looking everyplace for you . Really ? You 've been playing chess , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven 's an expert . Mm-hmm . Interesting situation . I 'm afraid you 're going to lose , my dear . We 'll see . Have a drink . No , thanks . I came down here because I have what I think will be very good news for you . You mean , no discrepancies . In your check-up on my story ? No discrepancies ... But you did n't finish your story . There 's an end to it ... Or , rather , a second beginning . What do you mean ? She 's alive . Who ? Matilda . I do n't believe it ! Alive and well and on her way home . I suppose she sent this to me . Because she did n't know where to reach you . Seems that our sorrow was a little premature . " Leaving Rio today . Arrive ... Tomorrow . " She arrives tomorrow . That 's right . We 'll all go down to meet her , banners flying , with a large , noisy band . That wo n't be necessary . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a familiar cue-Enter Matilda , exit Althea . I 'll buy that drink now , if you do n't mind . Help yourself . It is n't every day a man 's wife comes back from the grave . No . I believe you 're in considerable trouble . Check and mate In 3 . Good luck . Man , over loudspeaker : Flight number 7 from Rio De Janeiro . Landing at gate 3 . Man : Hey , what 's she doing taking a trip at a time like this , anyway ? Second man : What else would she do with all of her dough ? Well , she could give it to me . No sign of Grandison yet . You 'd think he 'd be here to cash in on that publicity . Let 's go ! There she is . Get a good shot of her , Joe . Do n't crowd her . How about a story , miss Frazier ? Do n't spare the details , miss Frazier . Give us the whole story . Was it a terrible experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must have been very exciting . What happened ? How does it feel to be dead ? Wo n't you please-Were you afraid when the ship caught fire ? We understand you were picked up by a fish trawler . Is that right ? Yes . It took us 3 weeks to get to brazil . Why did n't you send word you were still alive ? The boat that rescued us had no radio . Break it up . Ca n't you see ... Wait a minute ! We 've got a story here ! How about your plans for the future ? Victor let me come to meet you . When can we get a complete statement ? We 'll give you a statement later . Let 's get out of here . Feeling better ? Yes , thank you . But after all that 's happened , I ca n't understand why Grandy was n't there . He 's all right , is n't he ? He 's fine . He wanted to meet you , But he thought it would only complicate the publicity . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phone him later . Oh , good . You have n't changed . You 're as beautiful as ever . Well , that 's very kind of you . You know , I 'm afraid I did n't get your name . I 'm terribly sorry . I probably should have remembered , but I-Matilda , what is this ? You know who I am . I 've never seen you before in my life . Croton operator ? 48305 , please . A vermouth cassis for the lady . How do you know that ? That 's right , is n't it ? Brandy for me . Yes , sir , brandy . Hello ? Mr . Grandison , please . Is that Roslyn ? No , it 's Jane Moynihan . Hello , sir . This is Steve Howard . Yes , she 's here with me . Oh , Grandy , darling ! Of course I 'm well . I am happy . I 'm so anxious to see you . Tell Steven to bring you home . Mm-hmm . We 'll warm up a fatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There you are , sir . You 're pretty sold On Victor , are n't you ? He 's the kindest , most unselfish man I 've ever known . Yes , I know . I like him , too . I like him even more for what he means to you . Course , I ca n't say the same thing about Althea or Oliver , Although I think he regrets the way he treated you . I did n't know anyone knew about that . Why should n't I ? You know , it must 've been pretty horrible for you-The trouble with Oliver , the bitterness , the wedding , and after that , a shipwreck . I can understand why you 're so confused . About what ? In the car . Do n't you remember ? You told me you 'd never seen me before . I do n't anything hurt quite as much . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to hurt you . Please forgive me . You handed me quite a scare . I realize we did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant so little to you that you 'd completely forgotten me . Just your name . Is something wrong ? Yes . Something 's very definitely wrong . If you do n't remember my name . Howard . Steven Howard . Does n't that mean anything to you ? Afraid not . We must have met somewhere . You would n't be so sure . But I do n't quite remember . You do n't remember me At all ? I 'm sorry . All those weeks In brazil . Before you let anyone know you were alive ... Why ? What happened to you ? Why should you think something happened to me ? You were ill , were n't you ? Very ill . Well , yes . I was suffering from exposure and shock , if-Only that , or was there something more ? You had a nervous breakdown , did n't you ? Did n't you ? Yes . That explains it- amnesia and shock . I should have known when you told me about Oliver . I did n't tell you about Oliver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very table . This is where we met , Matilda . You 've forgotten . Why should I forget when there 's nothing to remember ? No ? Not even our marriage ? Marriage ? ! You 're my wife , Matilda . Well , that 's impossible . You 're Mrs . Steven Howard . Here 's our wedding certificate . It 's a forgery , and you 're lying . Why should I ? You know that better than I do . Perhaps because my father left me a fortune . So did mine . Shall we compare checkbooks ? No , it had nothing to do With your money . I married you Because I loved you . I know I was very ill , but They said it was hysteria . I remember everything that happened . The shipwreck , Oliver ... If I married you , why should I forget that and nothing else ? Probably because you wanted to . You were n't in love with me . I knew that when we were married . But I only-It is n't important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't marry you ! Waiter ... Yes , sir ? Thank you , sir . Did n't you like your Cassie , Mrs . Howard ? You bribed him to say that ! Well , there 's no use going on with this . If you do n't remember , or wo n't , that 's all there is to it . I 'll take you home , and that 's the last you 'll see of me . I do n't suppose you remember this , either . Should I ? We were on our way to be married . We took the next turnoff . Take it now . I 'd like to meet the man you say married us . How do you do ? Could you tell me If-My dear ! We read in the paper that you were safe . How very kind and thoughtful of you to come here , Mrs . Howard . But , you see , I 'm not Mrs . Howard . My wife would like to see Judge Maynard , if she may . Of course . Come right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge is performing . A wedding service in the study , but of course you remember . You 've seen me before ? I never forget a bride , No matter how many I 've seen . Just a moment . I 'll tell the judge you 're here . But it 's a mistake ! It must be ! Well , we were married . There 's no mistake about that . But I 'm afraid I rushed you into it , and I should n't have . But I do n't understand ! Why ca n't I remember ? Oh , my ! Well , goodbye ! Thank you so much . Goodbye ! My dear , I 'm so happy you 're safe . But you could n't possibly know who-My wife 's been under a great strain , judge . She does n't remember . There seems to be some doubt in her mind . Whether our marriage was The right thing or not . I see . If there 's anything I can do ... Perhaps there is , sir . In a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an annulment If you want to . Judge Maynard will help . Of course . I 'll do anything I can . You 're very kind . I 'm very grateful to you for being so patient with me . It 's all right , Matilda . I 'll take you home . Goodbye . You got to stop it , Mr . Grandison . I ca n't take any more ! I would n't entertain any awkward ideas about hastening my departure from the scheme of things if I were you , press . You got to leave me alone ! Will you please stop trying to convince yourself that you have enough courage to murder me ? And give me that ridiculous weapon . Give it to me , I say , before I lose my temper ... A thing I detest . I ca n't sleep , I ca n't eat . Not since that broadcast ... When you called me " The unsuspected . " How do you think I felt ? Well , if I were in your shoes , I should feel extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to hear something . Come along with me . For many years now , I 've been recording my programs . Before broadcasting them-Just for practice purposes-So that my listeners would have the benefit . Of every full , rich tone . Now , occasionally , this device has other uses , one of which I now commend to your attention . Press , on recording : I swear , Mr . Grandison , I did n't mean to kill her . I was only threatening her when she screamed . Victor , on recording : But you were overzealous , press . Why did n't you tell the police ? Press , on recording : I did n't dare . Victor , on recording : Why are you confessing to me ? Press , on recording : Because I ... Where did you Get that ? I made it ... On the occasion of your first visit . The microphone was hidden as you told me your story , So it turned out to be one of my best programs ... For which I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impetuous . Now , you do n't really imagine that I 'd be foolish enough to let you destroy the only copy , do you ? There are others . And if anything ever happens to me , the police will be listening to one of them . Why do n't you leave me alone ? I intend to . I work for my material . I have to call on many different kinds of people at many different times . What is it you want from me ? Nothing , actually . My interest in you is largely clinical . I am wondering , though , how long it will take the police to arrive at the same conclusions that led me to you . I could help them . I may have to . I could kill you ! What good would that do ? Here . And no more of that silly business . Goodbye . And do n't come here again . I 'll call you if I need you . You know , press , I rather enjoy playing God . That 's strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in out of the rain . Oh , please , not the front door . I do n't feel quite up to facing the others just yet . There 's an outside stairway leading up to my room . I can slip in without anyone knowing it . Please explain to Victor . Tell him I 'll talk to him in a little while . Althea : Well , darling ... You completely missed the welcome mat we put out for you . Why , Althea , I-I was just putting on a suitable face for your triumphal return . I did n't expect to find you here . Well , welcome home anyway , darling . You look as though you 'd been fished out of several oceans . I need a little time to pull myself together . I 'm afraid you 'll have a long pull . I took your room over Because ... Naturally , of course , we did n't think you were going to come back . I suppose you 'll want me to leave now . I really do n't care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find all of your things in my room . Oh , tell me one thing , darling . No , not about the shipwreck . I read enough about that in the newspapers . What I want to know is , how did you ever manage to catch a man like Steve Howard ? We always thought of you as such a quiet little mouse , and here you go and fool us all by snaring a millionaire husband . He isn't-a millionaire ? Oh , yes . Trust Victor to check on his financial background . Is n't it rather unfair ... You , with all the money in the world , and you marry more . And look at Oliver and me . Nobody ever left us a fortune , Neither one of us with a penny of our own . All we 've got is each other . Why are you looking at me like that ? I 'm not looking at you . I 'm seeing you for the first time . You think I 'm jealous . Why should you be ? I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from me . If you are going to leave , perhaps you 'd better go now . You 'll probably want a hot bath before dinner . Yes , I do want a bath ... But I 'll take it here , in my own room . But you just said-I 've changed my mind , Althea ... About many things . You can move your clothes out after dinner . May I suggest you take a very hot bath ? I thought it was amnesia at first . Now I 'm not so sure . Either Matilda ca n't or wo n't remember our marriage . You seem to be confronted with an awkward . And somewhat delicate situation . What do I do ? Divorce ? Annulment ? Do I stay or do I go ? I think the wisest thing to do is to stay . Perhaps , in time , she 'll remember . Meanwhile , as I understand it , your marriage was merely ... Legal . I would suggest , then , that you remain on with us for the time being ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane . You must be miss Moynihan . I am , but must I be ? I 'm Steve Howard . Will you join me in a cocktail , Mr . Howard ? I 'd much rather be together when I 'm drinking . You appeal to my Chivalry , miss Moynihan . I shall regard that as definite encouragement , Mr . Howard . After slaving all day over a hot typewriter , There 's nothing I like better than a swan dive into a bottle of bourbon . Why , Oliver ! Waiting for the bar to open ? No , I 'm just sitting here in the dark , counting my sins . Without an adding machine ? You must n't be unpleasant , Jane . It has absolutely no effect . She 's back , is n't she ? Matilda ? Is she happy ? Or do you mean , has she forgotten you ? I 'm selfish enough to hope she has n't . Oh , you men , you dogs in the manger . I 'm not thinking about myself . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt twice , And she 's no match for Althea . Mr . Howard , do you think you could manage to make yourself . A little less attractive to my wife ? Try being nasty . I have . Try harder . I don't-Oliver , if you ask me , Althea should be taken out regularly . And beaten like a rug . Who is it ? Oh , Grandy ! There , there , there ... Angel , you 're home , you 're safe , And we 're never going to let you get lost again . You 're crying ? Now , now , now , do n't cry . Do n't cry . I ca n't help it . I 'm so mixed up . But you always were mixed up , my dear , And we 've always straightened things out for you . I should 've stayed away . I should never have come back . Not come back here ? But this is your home . Your father 's house . I never forget it ... Though I 'm afraid Althea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grandy , never . But Althea-Now , you must n't blame Althea for marrying Oliver . She was in love with him . Course , I know what a blow . It must have been to your pride . It was more than pride . I was in love with him . Mm-hmm . Well , I think you 'll feel . Very differently when you see him . He 's changed , my dear ... And not for the better . And , of course , now that you 're Mrs . Steven Howard-Grandy , what do you know about Steven Howard ? That was going to be my question . He tells me you do n't remember marrying him . In fact , he says you do n't remember him at all . But I do n't . I did n't marry him . I do n't think I did . I 'm sure I 'd remember . I 'm sure you would , too . Unless ... Grandy , it could n't have been amnesia . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering up things we want to forget . And I think Mr . Howard 's a very clever young man . Who has gone to a great deal of trouble . To make you believe you 're married to him . But why should he ? When we know the answer to that , my dear , We 'll know how to deal with him . What can we do ? Nothing . Just play along with him ... For the present . We 'll keep this to ourselves , shall we ? Imagine what the newspapers would do with it . When the time comes , I 'll know how to cope with him . Now , are you going to get your hair fixed before coming down to dinner ? Grandy , would you mind terribly . If I did n't come down tonight ? I 'm so tired . Of course you are . You know , this house was lonely for you . It seemed so gray and depressing while you were gone . Now it 's bright . You 're alive again . So am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire where you 've been ? I 'm sorry , sir . I mean . I 'm sorry , sir . I did n't know you were up , sir . Mr . Howard asked me to drive him to the station . At this hour of the morning ? He wanted to catch The 7:15 . Only thieves and home-going Casanovas catch the 7:15 train in the morning . Well , he took it . Did he take any luggage with him ? No , sir . No luggage , sir . Did you want something , sir ? Breakfast , if it is n't asking too much . Asking too much . Yes , sir . I mean , no , sir . Kent : Yes , sir . Sorry I was late . I always have more face to put on in the morning . Drive on , please . Did Victor See you leave ? I do n't think so . What about your reporter friend ? Did he come through ? Yeah . He got these out of the file . Good . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were right . I checked . You 've certainly been a big help , Jane . I 'll do all I can , Steve . We 're going through with it just as we planned . You 'll be at the house tonight ? Mm-hmm . Fine . If I do n't get back in time for dinner , I 'll phone Victor my apologies . Please be careful . I will . I 'm afraid he 's suspicious . Why ? I told him Matilda did n't recognize me . Naturally , he liked that . Of course . A husband to share his ward 's millions . Is the last thing he wants . Did you bring that letter Roslyn wrote you ? Yes . I put it in my bag this morning . Written the day before she died . Does n't sound much like a girl who was tired of living , does it ? Oh , you do n't have to sell me , Steve . I know as well as you do that Roslyn never committed suicide . Matilda . It 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all it means to you ? What did you expect ? Why , Matilda , what a lovely gown . Hello , Althea . Thank you . I bought it in Rio . Oh . Grandy ! If that 's a Brazilian gown , I 'll leave for Argentina tomorrow . Well , our sleeping beauty has awakened at last . You look radiant , my lamb , but then , you should , Having slept the clock round . I needed the rest to face tonight . I 'm sorry I was so silly , but ever since I knew I was coming home , I 've dreaded this moment . And what about now ? It 's the first time I 've felt at ease ... As though I belonged here . Of course you belong here . Cheers . Come along , my dear . We have a vermouth cassis for you . Hello , Nancy . Welcome home , miss . Good evening , Kent . It 's nice to have you back , miss Matilda . Why , thank you . We missed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uh , uh , do n't ... move , my dear . Do you know you 've changed ? I have ? Oliver : No , Matilda has n't changed ... The painting has . It just died . Oh ... I have n't seen Roslyn yet . Oh , hello , Ro- Well , hello , Jane . Hello , darling . You look wonderful . Would a shipwreck do that for me ? Every girl should have one at least twice a year . I thought you were Roslyn . I 've been making a few changes in Victor 's script . Our writers have been shipwrecked for some time now . Thought I 'd finish it before dinner sets in . It 's good to see you . Where is Roslyn ? You have n't heard ? Heard ? What ? Roslyn 's dead . She was found hanging from that chandelier . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Jane : Hello ? Yes , just a moment , please . Victor ... telephone . Here . Thank you . Hello ? Victor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . My dear fellow , I 'm on the verge of dining . After dinner , then . I 'm afraid I must insist . I 'm sorry . It 's very important . Very well , if you 're going to be unpleasant about it . Come along at 9:00 . I 'll give you some poisoned coffee . Good . I 'll see you then . You want to keep her letter ? No . No , I think I have everything I need right here . Bring me the file on the Roslyn Wright suicide . Ok , chief . One of the newspapers took this picture . You were standing here , in front of the electric clock . Victor : I do n't understand . Look what time the clock says in the picture . 9:35 . What does that mean ? The way we figure it , there was a struggle . This lamp was knocked over . That caused a short circuit and blew out a fuse downstairs . That stopped the clock and gives us the exact time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important . Take these books . The murderer arranged them so that we 'd think . That Roslyn had used them to reach the chandelier . Mystery of the Headless Corpse . I read that . That 's not bad . Quite a good detective in it . Uh , go on . Hmm ? Oh , yes . Well , now we come to the point . The phone company keeps a record . Of all long-distance calls . At exactly 9:34 that night , A call was put through from New York to this phone . Roslyn answered it . That means she must have seen the murderer . Now , what we want to know is , Why have n't we heard from whoever put through that call ? And most important of all ... Who hung up this phone ? Of course . Roslyn could n't have done it . Right . Very extraordinary . Do you know , I think you 've discovered . Something terribly important . Why , it changes the entire complexion of the case . How did you manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our department is . Well , I certainly hope you run this down . Poor child . Whatever could have been the motive ? When we know that , we 'll know who killed her . Matilda . I did n't mean to frighten you . You think you can keep avoiding me forever ? Oh , Oliver , I 'm not avoiding you . There 's so much I want to say to you . I 've got to say to you . Look at me , Matilda . You know , once , I would n't have . Been able to look at you ... Without remembering . Now it does n't seem to matter . Victor is right . You have changed . And you , Oliver ? Are you the same ambitious young man who was going to change the course of history ? Or are you- a drunk ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? It is n't important now . It is to me . Tonight when I saw you , I realized what I 've been running away from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does n't that mean anything to you ? I 'm sorry . Is it because you 're married ? Because you 're in love with Steve Howard ? Yes ... Maybe that is what I mean . Hello . Good evening . Do you mind if we have a look in the cellar ? I 'd like to check on the fuse system . You know the way . I do n't expect to find anything , But it wo n't hurt to look . Well , Victor , you finally have . A murder case in your own home . Yes . Murder ? ! What did he mean ? My dear ... Tell me , Grandy ! What is it ? Roslyn did n't Kill herself . She was murdered . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's right through here and down the stairs . I 'll get the light . Watch your step . Mm-hmm . Boy , look at all that vino . You watch your step . You know , when I was in Okinawa , We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Right over here . Living room ... Seems to work . Library ... But why ? What reason could anyone have ? I do n't suppose we 'll ever know , poor child . I 'm afraid this has n't been a very happy homecoming . Oh , make them stop ! Make them stop ! There , there ... Oh , it 's just coming home ... And now this . I know , my dear . It 's all been too much for you . Come along . Come along . Kent , do you ever cheat at solitaire ? Cheat ? Oh , no , miss . I do , and I hate myself for it . Oh ... There it goes again . I wonder what 's wrong with the lights ? Nothing . You 're going blind . Uh , blind-Blind ? Well , Victor ... Hmm ? Oh ... Yeah , you 've been down in the cellar , have n't you ? What did you find ? Nothing of any importance . Before we go , we 'd like to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Howard . Modern marriage is beyond me . Well , ask her to drop in my office in the morning . There are one or two things I 'd like to talk to her about . Of course , yes . By the way , Victor , it 's purely routine , of course , But where were you the night of Roslyn 's murder ? Doing my broadcast- " The Morgan Affair . " Do n't you remember ? You gave me the-Now , do n't tell me that you were n't listening . That 's the one I missed . What train did you take that night . The 8:30 or the 9:00 ? My dear fellow , it 's very obvious that you 've missed . More than one of my broadcasts , Or you 'd know that I 'm not off the air until 8:30 . I always catch the later train . That does n't get here until 9:55 . 10 minutes from the station to here ... Means you got home At 10:05 . Very precise . Why is this so-Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you needed it very much , But it 's good to have things settled . Mr . Donovan , do you mind driving me in ? I 'm afraid to go home alone . You 'll be quite safe with us . That 's what I was afraid of . Good night , Victor . Good night . Jane : I 'm always missing that train , but I do meet interesting people hitchhiking this way . It 's not very flattering . Been looking at your watch all evening . Sorry . You know , you implied a great deal . When you asked me to come out here . What 's the matter ? Have you changed your mind ? No , I have n't changed my mind . You 're a funny guy , Steve . Am I ? Been a long time since I met anyone . That interested me half as much as you do , And that 's a gross understatement . You need a drink . No , Oliver . Let me take care of this . You go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do as I say . Oh , come on , Steve . Come on and sit down beside me . I 'm lonely-terribly lonely . Bored , maybe . Bored and lonely . You think because I live in this house , Basking in Victor 's glory and Matilda 's money , that I like it . I hate it ! I like to break things . Glass breaking is the most wonderful sound in the whole world . Why do n't you like Matilda ? She 's been very kind to you . Kind ? She can afford to be . Her father left her millions . My father died without a cent . Victor had to take me in . His penniless niece . He was glad to take her in-very glad . " The Little Heiress . " It 's all I 've heard from the time I was 10 years old . Do n't you think you 've had enough ? I suppose so . I usually do n't drink this much . So I 'll know what I 'm saying-The proper questions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be careless ... And talk too much . You do n't know what it is to have to say thank you to somebody you do n't like for everything you get-day after day , year after year ! I never had anything of my own . Until I thought she was dead . Then Victor gave me everything I ever wanted . And now she 's back , and all I 've got is ... Oliver . But Victor could continue to do things for you . How ? Victor has very expensive tastes . Takes every cent he makes to live the way he does-More than every cent . Oh , why did she have to come back ? Now I have had too much to drink . I was just beginning to get interested . Interested or curious ? Both . I keep wondering . About the girl who was murdered-Victor 's secretary . Roslyn ? She was n't murdered . She killed herself . She was murdered . The police have evidence . How do you know ? I gave it to them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can take care of myself . Easy , Althea . All right ... I do know something . I talked to Roslyn that night . I heard her scream . Victor , I 've made up my mind . I 'm going away . What about your wife ? My wife ? I have no claims on Althea . She belongs to mankind . I think you 've made a very wise decision . You 've been very patient with Althea ... Entirely too patient . Going away , if only for a few days , will teach her a much needed lesson . Just exactly what lesson is Althea to be taught ? The lesson of humility , my dear . You see , Oliver is leaving you . Did you have anything to do with this ? Sounds like one of your clever little plots . No , it was my own idea . Really ? An idea of your own ? You see , Oliver has become aware of your-What shall I call it ? - Your attachment to Mr . Howard , And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurting Matilda . Oh . The knight to the rescue . Are you carrying her on your white charger ? No . From now on , I ride alone . Who 's going to pry you loose from the bar ? I think you 'd better excuse me . I detest scenes not of my own making . You know , the more I see of marriage , The more thankful I am to be the last . Of a long line of bachelors . What 's gotten into you , Oliver ? I 'd rather not have a quarrel , if you do n't mind . I 'm not going to swoon at the idea of losing you , But I am entitled to an explanation . All right , I 'll give you one-Carefully selected 4- letter words . You 're not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since . You knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! As a matter of fact , I am . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think I married you ? Because of your charm ? I only married you for one reason , and that was to get you away from Matilda . And I 'll do the very same thing with Steve . You 're going to leave him alone . Do you hear me ? You 're not going to cause her any more unhappiness , or-I do n't like to be threatened . I can threaten , too . It will give me a great deal of pleasure . To break up our dear little Matilda 's marriage . I 'll kill you first . Really ? You plan to shoot me , stab me , or , uh ... String me up like poor Roslyn ? Oh , I 'm fed up with your cheap heroics ! Go on , get out of here ! Please , please . Althea , Oliver ... You have no idea how your voices carry . I can hear you from the other end of the house . Well , then get him out of here . We 'll discuss that later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliver , be smart . Pack your bag , enough things for a few days , And go right away from here . All right , Victor . You know best . Ah ... Ca n't we postpone this lecture till some other time ? This room gives me the creeps . I like it . The outside world is so far away in here . I ca n't hear it ... it ca n't hear me . That 's why I had the room soundproofed ... So I can be completely alone . Completely undisturbed . What is it you wanted to speak to me about ? A phone call , my dear . The phone call you put through to this house . The night that Roslyn was murdered . The phone call that Mr . Donovan has succeeded in tracing . The one with which you aroused . Mr . Howard 's interest a few minutes ago . I did n't say anything to him . Oh , dear . I 've tried so hard to teach you the value of truth . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves , But I thought it was rather unfriendly of you . To accuse me of having murdered Roslyn . You ca n't frighten me . You would n't dare do anything to me ! I want the truth , Althea . Did you or did you not tell Mr . Howard . That I murdered Roslyn ? Yes . I said I thought so . And why did n't you share your suspicion . With the police , or at least tell them of the phone call ? I was afraid of what would happen to you . Always thinking of your dear uncle . That 's right . Sit down . You and I were enjoying Matilda 's money , were n't we ? Now that she 's come back , What do you suppose is going to happen to you ? You 'll take care Of me , Victor . You must have money hidden away- money Matilda could never trace . You and Roslyn had one trait in common : You were both much too inquisitive . Oh ... So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pity , is n't it ? You were always my favorite . You know that , do n't you ? So charmingly unscrupulous ... But so greedy . It 's too bad . Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't ! Victor ? Victor ? Oliver . Victor , I wanted to tell you that I 'm leaving . If I could call a cab-You 'll do nothing of the kind . With a garage full of cars ? Here 's the key to the coupe . You use my hotel room in town for a couple of days . I 'll call the clerk and tell them to expect you . Tomorrow , you and Althea are going to feel very differently about this . I 'll get your coat for you . Here you go , Oliver . Thanks , Victor . Thanks for everything . Not at all . Good luck . And do n't forget you 've been drinking , Oliver . Drive carefully . I will . Matilda , I ... I saw your light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep running away from me . You-you might have phoned . Anyway , I have nothing to say to you . Is that perfectly clear ? Perfectly . But you 're going to listen to me , just the same . You 're in a great deal of danger . You 've got to get out of this house . Are n't you being a little bit theatrical ? Maybe I am ... But your life wo n't be worth much if Victor finds out what Althea 's been telling me . What are you talking about ? Oliver did n't break your engagement because he wanted to . It was all arranged by Victor . That 's not true . And if Roslyn had been warned as I 'm warning you , she 'd be alive today . Roslyn ? Do n't you realize it 's because I want to help you ? Because I . Do n't want anything to happen to you . You 've got to trust me , Matilda . Oh , Steve , I want to . I 'd like to believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe Grandy would do anything to hurt me . Althea , on recording : You 're not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! Oliver , on recording : As a matter of fact , I am . Well , it wo n't do you any good . Why do you think I married you ? Because of your charm ? I only married you for one reason , And that was to get you away from Matilda . Matilda ! Matilda , it 's Oliver and Althea . They 've been drinking . I 've never seen a man in such a blind rage . You 're the only one he 'll listen to . Why , Howard . I had no idea ... Come along , Matilda . Break up our dear little Matilda 's marriage . I 'll kill you first . Really ? Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , this is awful ! No sign of him . He must have gotten away . Operator ... Get me police headquarters , please . Code number 99 . Hard-top , light gray coupe . New York , 4h23022 . Probably using Sawmill River Highway . Caution-Man is armed . Repeating . Code number ... Rifling checks on the bullets . The bullet that killed Althea was fired from this gun . Well , I suppose that makes it official . You can add , Steve . Two plus two equals-Oliver . My addition does n't come out the same . Ca n't argue with mathematics . I 'm sorry . As far as this department is concerned , The case is closed . Thanks anyway , Donovan . Goodbye . Goodbye . Two cups ? Yes , I like to drink with two hands . I 'm sorry , Jane . The train was late . That 's all right . Lemon , please . Lemon . You 're just in time to keep me from drinking something that would do me no harm . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just thought you might like to get away from that house for a while . It 's been awful . The police questioning , the funeral ... Was n't very cheerful . How could it be ? I mean , it 's so big that even the closets have an echo . Why , there 's Steve ! Fancy finding you here . Small world , is n't it ? Yes . Come on over and sit down . If you do n't mind . Hello , Matilda . Hello , Steve . Oh , my goodness , I just remembered . I forgot an appointment . I 've got to go downtown and match a goldfish . Goodbye . Is everything all right , Mrs . Howard ? My dear , sweet man , will you do me a favor-A very big favor ? Yes , ma'am . Get lost . Yes , ma'am . Is there anything Else , sir ? No , that will be All , thank you . Thank you , sir . Very conscientious waiter . He wants to give me My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I bribed him . To call any woman he saw me with " Mrs . Howard . " Then we 're not married . No . You see , I had to get into Grandison 's house , And the only way I could do it was to pretend we were . I had to find out why Roslyn died . Steve , did you know Roslyn ? Yes . We grew up together . It was sort of taken for granted we 'd be married someday . I suppose we would 've if it had n't been for the war . I 'm sorry . I had n't seen her for over 3 years . When I came back from overseas , she was dead . Her aunt and uncle never believed , and neither did I , That she 'd committed suicide . Her uncle had seen her only the day before she died . He was the man who was supposed to have married us-Judge Maynard . Naturally , he was interested . In finding out what really happened to his niece . I , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matilda . You were a very convincing liar . The words were lies . The emotions were honest . And I want to be sure that nothing happens to you . Nothing can . Oliver 's dead . Oliver did n't kill anybody . The same thing happened to him . That happened to Althea and Roslyn . He was murdered by your kind , generous guardian , Victor Grandison . Look , Steve , I do n't know why you hate Grandy so much , but I will not listen to you saying such things about him . Listen to me ! For the last two days , I 've been running down all the scattered clues . Victor 's very clever , but I think I know how he managed . For us to hear the argument between Oliver and Althea . He had an alibi the night Roslyn died . He said he was at the broadcast . And could n't have caught that early train . I listened to a record of that broadcast , and timed it . He left early that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he had , but that does n't prove he did . I 'll never believe it . Oh , Steve , I wish it did n't have to be like this . If you only knew how much I liked you , You would n't try to make me believe that Grandy-Do n't you see it ? I do n't want to talk about it ! Matilda ! Just leave me alone ! Do n't go back there , Matilda ! Anything wrong , Mrs . Howard ? So he finally admitted that you were n't married , after all . Very interesting ... Not married , never have been . I suppose I should hate him . And do you ? Of course you do n't . In spite of what he 's done and said about me , I think you 're in love with him , are n't you ? Are n't you ? Yes , I guess I am in love with him . And I feel like such a traitor to you . But why should you ? This has been a dreadful misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steven are going to live happily ever after . Then you do n't object ? My dear , I can be philosophical about everything ... Including love , which seems to me to be a curiously unhappy blend of tears and laughter . But if that 's what you want , You have my blessing . Oh , Grandy ! If he only knew you as I do . If he only knew you as you really are ! Perhaps he does , my dear . Perhaps he does . Well , this is n't ... Getting on with my radio script for tonight . I , uh ... I do n't know what happened to Jane . She should be here . She knows I have to dictate these gruesome things . I could help you , Grandy . I used to . Remember ? Oh , of course you did . Yes . Come on over here . Not as efficiently as Jane , but if you 'll go slowly-Oh , yes . I 'll go slowly . Now , uh , now this is uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , no , do n't ... do n't put that down . I 'm just explaining the story . Mary Phillips has just seen her parents ... brutally murdered , and feels that she can no longer live without them . Now , her farewell note must be simple , yet convincing . Now , let me ... See . Uh ... " Having lost two who Were most dear to me , " I find life empty , Bitter ... " and too lonely . " Got that ? " May those who are my friends try to forgive me " for taking this way out ... " Of a cruel and uncompromising world . " There 's Your Steven Howard . He 's on his way down to the garage . Now we 'll ... Wipe all the shadows away . Why , your eyes are shining , but in such a woebegone little face . Now , you ... You run along and change it , and fix yourself , because this is going to be a moment you 'll always remember . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone with my memories , darling , of your sweetness and your tender affection for me . Grandy , do n't talk like that . Even if I did marry Steve , I would n't be leaving you forever . Besides , I do n't know how he feels about me . We 'll find that out . Just leave it to me . Oh , and , uh , Remember ... Look your prettiest . Yeah ? I know who it is . I need you . Yes . Will you come along as soon as you can , please ? I 'll be waiting for you in the garage . Thank you . Press . You made good time . Hello , Kent . I thought This was your night off . It is , sir , but the others had left , and I thought-Oh , nonsense . Of course you can go . Here . Take a couple of tickets for my broadcast tonight . Thank you , sir , but your program frightens me . I do n't like it . Do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! Althea , on recording : Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't ! Get me police headquarters . Donovan , homicide . Donovan , this is Steve Howard . I-Hello ? Operator , there seems to be some trouble on this line . Can you clear it ? Thank you . Hello ? If you 'll call me back at Croton 48305 . That 's right . Hello , Mr . Grandison . Hello , Mr . Howard . Just why are you here ? To pick up my belongings . I trust you have everything you came for . Almost . Are n't you forgetting ... Matilda ? No , I have n't forgotten Matilda . I 've been very patient with you , young man ... Extremely patient . You enter my house-Matilda 's house . You enter this house under false pretenses . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongings . You delude us all into believing in this fantastic marriage . Did it ever occur to you that I could have you arrested as an impostor ? Yes , it did ... but an arrest and trial with the evidence it would bring out ? You have a great deal of courage , Mr . Grandison , But not that much . I do n't know what 's going on in the back of your mind , But whatever it is , I shall be very interested to see what happens to you . I hope you wo n't be disappointed , Mr . Grandison . I was just leaving . I want to talk to you . Yes , I talked to Victor . Come to the guesthouse right away . I 'll be down in just a minute . Use the outside stairway . Hurry , darling . Steve ? Steve ! Oh , hello , Press . Hello , miss . Grandy ! Grandy ... Now what ? Where have you been ? What were you doing Out there ? Steve called me from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his car is n't in the garage . I saw Press . Oh , I should 've asked Press about Steve . Perhaps He can tell me-You stay here . Have you taken leave of your senses-Running about out there , chasing this man , screaming with hysteria ? But , Grandy , Steve might-Steve ? Steve ? Is that all you can think about ? Is that all you can talk about ? If you do n't get hold of yourself , your mind will crack . I 'm sorry , my dear . I 'm afraid I 've behaved rather badly . You did n't believe a word I said , did you ? It 's just that I ... Well , today , I seem to have reached the breaking point . My nerves are ragged , what with Jane not showing up . To help me with the broadcast , And Steve 's abrupt appearance ... Oh , that reminds me . I could have spared us both this disagreeable scene . Steve had some trouble with his car . He took the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that he 'd be right back . But why did n't you tell me before ? Oh , that 's easily explained . We 've all been a little upset . It would be a miracle if we were n't . But are you going to forgive your crusty old Grandy ? What we need is something for our nerves . We 'll have a little wine , and we 'll talk this thing over calmly and logically . Come along , Matilda . Come on . This will bring the sparkle back to your eyes . Well , do n't you want to drink with me ? No , thank you , Grandy . You do n't want Steven to come back and find you looking like a ghost , do you ? To please me . You know I do n't like drinking alone . I wonder if that's-I 'll take it . Hello ? It 's 10 minutes . I 'm Calling , like you said . Hello , Steve . Well , I 'm certainly glad you called . We were worried about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh ... She 's right here . In 20 minutes ? Let me talk to him . Yes , I 'll tell her , Steve . What ? Let me talk to him . Just a minute , Steve . She wants to talk to you . Hello , Steve . Hello ? Hello ? Oh ... He must have hung up . Do you think he 'll call back ? Why should he ? He said he 'd be here in 20 minutes , As soon as the car is . I 'm going to be late for my rehearsal . Here . Here 's to you both . Is n't this wine a little bitter ? " Dry " is the word , dear-dry . Let me fill it up for you . That will be enough , thank you . I feel much better . Good . It 's my best vintage- ' 28 . Oh , it 's wonderful . Oh , I feel so relaxed . That 's how I want you to feel . Finish it , my dear . Finish it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away , Grandy . So far away ... Can you hear me , Matilda ? Can you hear me ? So far away ... I 've never been closer to you . You must n't say that , Steve . Grandy 's always been kind to me-always . Oh ... I 'll miss you ... Steve ... Steve ... " Having lost two who were most dear to me , " I find life empty , bitter , and too lonely . May those who are my friends try to forgive me for taking this way out . " Of a cruel and uncompromising world . " Steve ! Steve ! Steve ... Steve ? Steve ! Careful . Wake up , Matilda . Open your eyes . You 're doing fine . Wake up , Matilda ! You better keep on walking her , chief . On your feet . That 's right . No , come on . Walk . Walk . That 's it . Get me some coffee . Tried to kill me . He would have if Steve had n't phoned me . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ... General description . Blue body , red wheels . Feeling all right ? License-2h470j . That 's it - Press ' truck . Hmm ? I remember I saw it parked in front of the garage . Press . This is Donovan calling headquarters on that 48 you just broadcast .

@@5883516 This is the story of a squad of marines , a rifle squad . I 'm Corporal Robert Dunne , a member of that squad . We were at Guadalcanal , and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest , refitting , replacements and retraining . The Marine Corps is long on training and retraining ... Let that go . After the canal , we were sent to Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand . Here we received our replacements , marines from Stateside , a long way from Stateside , 8,000 miles . I can see you 're a man who knows how to live . - Solid comfort . - Solid malaria . - Malaria , huh ? Contagious ? - No , not this week . You can stay . Nice place you got here . Regazzi 's my name , Benny Regazzi . Bob Dunne . I 'm duty NCO today . Great . Meet my friends . This big guy is " Handsome " Dan Shipley . - Hi . - What a physique ! The girls see him and faint . He comes through this , I 'll make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eddie and that 's Frank . - Hi , Eddie . - Hello , Bob . They do n't drink . I got their beer ration . - And Georgie Hellenopolis , an Irishman . - Hello , sport . - Where did you get those cards ? - Off your sack on the ship . Why ? - They 're mine , that 's why . - I 've seen lots in those bags that aren't . - Come on , give me . - " Semper fi " , Mac . - Hey ! - Leave them . It happens 20 times a day . You know where those guys come from ? Philadelphia , the city of brotherly love . - By the way , who 's the squad leader ? - Sergeant Stryker . - What 's he like ? - You 'll find out . I 've been in New Zealand two hours and already they 're clamming up on me . - I hope he knows his stuff . - Maybe we 'll get liberty . - We ai n't replacements any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's here . - Well , what do you know ? Stryker . - Hello , Thomas . - Thought you were in the First . - I was . Sit down . Just sit down , Thomas , anywhere . My name is Stryker , Sergeant John M Stryker . You 're gon na be my squad , a rifle squad . Three of us have seen action : Corporal Dunne , Charlie Bass and myself . You 'll learn from us . In boot camp you learned out of a book . Here you got ta remember the book and learn things that have n't been printed . You got ta learn right and fast . Any man that does n't want to cooperate , I 'll make him wish he had n't been born . Before I 'm through with you , you 're gon na move and think like one man . If you do n't , you 'll be dead . You guys have had a nice easy day . I hope you enjoyed it because it 's the last one you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight and you 'll get your chance . I 'll show you how . If I ca n't teach you one way , I 'll teach you another . But I 'll get the job done . The skipper of this outfit is Captain Joyce . Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker . Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright . Any questions ? That 's all . 10,000 sergeants in this corps and I draw Stryker ! You knew this guy before ? Yeah . We were stationed together in China . Twice he kept me from promotion . Turned me in once . 30 days I got . He was a sergeant major then . Must have done something to get busted to three stripes . What did he turn you in for ? For ... That 's not important ! What 's important is that he turned me in ! Maybe he did n't write the manual , but you can bet he can recite it backwards ! - It 's probably tattooed on his chest . - Front and back , Mac . - Say , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you a fighter ? - Just in the Marines . - Runner-up in the heavyweight division . - Tell him who you were runner-up to . Stryker . Lucky punch . Meet your new manager . Tell him why you lost your stripes . My natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate . Do n't let this guy do your thinking . You 'll get a square deal from Stryker . You bet . Square deal . I 'm looking forward to the first time he and I come head to head off duty . Hey , take it easy with that hand , champ ! Saddle up ! - All right , take a break . - Take a break . - How does your squad look ? - See me in about six months . Conway ! I was checking the records . Your father was Colonel Sam Conway . - What if he was ? - I was with him ten months ago . He was my CO before he got killed . One of the best officers and finest men I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Thanks . I 'll keep it in mind . - For that , you sleep with your rifle . - It was an accident . - Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle . - Fall in ! All right , saddle up . Pick it up . Sometimes I do n't know which I hate worse , him or the Nips . - Your father was a good marine . - Until ten months ago . - You shipped in when he was killed . - I shipped in because I was expected to . In war the men of my family join the Marines . I 'm the last Conway , so here I am . He 'd be proud that you 're carrying on the tradition . Not my father . He 'd have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere . - In fact , he told me so . - I do n't get it . I embarrassed my father . I was n't tough enough for him . Too soft . " No guts " was the phrase he used . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man I ever served under . " I bet they got along just fine . Both with ramrods strapped on their backs . I 'm a civilian , not a marine . They 're not going to strap one on mine . I 'm in here strictly for tradition . - That the only reason ? - Yeah . Why ? Nothing ... Stryker knows his business . So did Jack the Ripper . Knock off the skylarking . You 're in the wrong column . Left foot close in there . Look alive ! Choynski , you 're all left feet ! Choynski ! What do you think you 're doing ? - Running the bayonet course , sir . - Not in this league . Yes , sir . Your men are pretty ragged , Stryker . Yes , sir . That ought to take some starch out of Stryker . His boys did n't do so well . Hanging him up between those poles , we 'd do a lot better . Choynski ! OK , so I 'm left-handed . - On guard . Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't learn the easy way , you 'll learn the hard way . Make a thrust . - Without a scabbard ? - You heard me . - You mean this way ? - Yeah , like this ! You get the idea ? Corpsman ! All right , saddle up . We 'll do it again . Pick it up . You 're the only unkissable guy in camp . This thing hurts . It ai n't funny . No dame 's going to come near a mouth like this . Do n't worry , I got the scoop . No liberty for three months . You got time . - Three months ? How did you get that ? - I got spies everywhere . They ought to throw the book at Stryker for doing this . They wo n't . They 'll give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines . Choynski ! They tell me you 're going to live . You were lucky today . Someone had been instructing you that did n't like you , you might not have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Somebody who did n't like me ? I wonder what he does to the guys he hates . 365 days in a year and I got ta pick this one to nick myself ! You need a blow torch on your stubble . Look who 's putting out the scuttlebutt . No liberty , he says ! Somebody made a mistake . You got no kick coming . You have , so do n't go turning your back . Will we take Hollywood with them physiques ! - First Platoon ! - That 's for me ! - Here , Wright , any mail for Stryker ? - No . It 's going to be rugged again tonight . He wo n't solve his problems with whiskey . What would you do if your wife left with your kid ? - After five years I 'd forget it . - Stryker 's not much on forgetting . - Sorry , no letter for you . - I know it . You know ten-year-olds . There could be a thousand reasons why he did n't write . - A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? - Brushing me . The kid 's all right . - Maybe Mary influenced him not to . - That she would n't do . Of course not . Stryker , you 're a very unusual character . - Can this be love ? - You know what I mean . A lot of guys would n't see that a woman needs a husband who 's not always away . A woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day . - You can tell me to shut up . - If you ca n't talk to me , who can ? - Do n't do it , just for once , do n't do it . - Do what ? Do n't start out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk . Nobody starts out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk . Some do . Why not leave half your dough with me ? You got an old maid 's failings . You worry . Do n't try to follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of yours . - Ready ? - Just a minute . - What 's up ? - Nothing . Benny did n't strip his M1 fast enough for Stryker , so he turned him in . They cancelled his liberty . Perhaps our sergeant has n't got a heart of gold after all , but he certainly is ... You talk too much . You think I restricted Flynn for my own amusement ? The punishment 's unreasonable , to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake . I 'm gon na tell you something , Conway . I 'm gon na tell all of you . I 'm gon na make it simple so you 'll all understand it . They handed me you guys as a present , a regular Easter basket . They told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war . That 's what I 'm gon na do and that means I 'm gon na tell you what to do every day , how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na jump and when I land it 'll hurt . I 'll ride you until you ca n't stand up . When you do , you 'll be marines . Flynn stays here . Extra-hard product of a hard school . Tough luck , Flynn . - If my brother does n't go , I 'm not going . - Shut up ! - Who are you telling to shut up ? - You ! Let 's go before we all lose our liberty . I wan na see those Wellington babes . - How do you feel , boy ? - Like a little bird with feathers on it . - Do n't fly away , little bird . - I ca n't . I 'm still in the egg . Beautiful , beautiful ! I wan na dance . You 're gon na sit down . Yes , ma'am , Tennessee , that 's where I come from . The greatest state in the Union . They call it the volunteer state . Right there is where I 'm from . Smithville , Tennessee , what a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and these are on my papa 's side . We got the best tobacco there is , too . More fertiliser comes from Tennessee than any other place in the world . Listen to that band ! Zombies ! They 're all dead . - Maybe they like music that way here . - Or do n't know any other kind . - I 'm talking these boys into a session . - Maybe they do n't have it in them . After I 'm through , they will . They 're breaking my heart . Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful ! - There is a happy man . - Wait until tomorrow . - Do n't be a killjoy , dance . I 'll watch him . - I 'm not much on dancing . - You might try just this once . - No , thanks . - Pete 's my name , Pete Conway . - Allison . - Hello , Allison . - Hello , Pete . - You 're warm . Want to sit down ? - No . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mac . What would you say if I suggested we get some air ? I 'd say I 'm not supposed to leave the club with servicemen , but to you I 'd say yes . Now what ? We know all about each other . - You 'll be missing your train . - I 'll float back on thin air . Do n't do that . You might catch cold . Funny , I 've just met you and I feel I 've known you all my life . I feel that way , too . - Ten thousand miles away . - Not now . I wan na see you again , every time I get liberty . I 'll be here . - Allison ... - Yes ? I 'm glad I met you tonight . - The train ... - I know . I 'll walk you to the station . I can get a taxi from there . - No , I 'll walk you home . - No . You might miss your train . I might not see you again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , just call her up . Man , what a barmaid ! - I 'll finish the war right here . - Drink any more and you probably will ! New Zealand ai n't got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey ! We 'll drink worse before we get through . They may bury me at sea tomorrow , but tonight I got that nice , warm feeling . I got a great future for the next two hours . You 're bleeding ! Lipstick ! - Hey , fellas , look what I found ! - Hey , sports ... look . - Boy , he 's really carrying a load ! - Gyrene ! Hey , Mac , you 're a little off your course . - Well , what do you know ! Stryker . - He 's sure a mess . Now I know what happened to those stripes . Come on . Shore Patrol . - That 's what it is . Give me a hand . - You 're going to help him ? If he cut my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them get him . What a break ! He 's all set to drop two stripes and Shore Patrol shows up . - But look what he done to me ! - Do n't tell me he kissed you . That 's a great one ! Did I tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened ... - I do n't know why you 're helping him . - I 'll take care of it . - Where did you come from ? - Never mind . He do n't need you guys . - How do you like that ? - He must follow Stryker like a little dog . What do you care ? At least he took him off our hands . A day after our leave , we drew a 22-mile hike over terrain carefully selected . All uphill , and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside . Do you believe in love at first sight ? All kinds . I never did before but I sure do now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Because I 'm thinking about it now . - I 'm gon na marry that girl . - What girl ? - The girl I met last night . - You 'll feel better in the morning . I could n't feel any better than I do right now . I 've been thinking , why do men get married during a war ? - Do n't know . - It 's the worst time . I fooled around but I never thought about marriage . I know a lot of girls back in the States but ... I think it 's because when you get out here you 're close to things . You realise way down inside , no matter how much you try not to think about it , that maybe something 's got your number on ... and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind . Does n't matter if it 's a boy or a girl , just so long as you wo n't be forgotten . There 'll be someone who 'd never have lived if it had n't been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . - Hey , Conway , got a pass ? - I have . All right , hop in . I 'll give you a lift . - I hear you got a girl in town . - What if I have ? - They say she 's a very nice girl . - They talk too much . Are you serious about her ? With things the way they are , this is no time to start getting serious with a girl . Do n't know how long you 're gon na be here or when you 'll be back again . Do n't even know how long you 'll live . If it 's in the line of duty , you can tell me to do something and I 'll do it . As for my personal life , keep your hands off . - Your father would 've said it . - I would n't have listened . - You never did . - How do you know ? - He told me . - What did he say ? I 'll tell you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be able to stand up for myself , right ? - You 're doing the talking . - No , my father is . Every time you open your mouth , he 's talking . Every thought you think is his . It 's as though he 's at my shoulder . But he did n't always say or think the right thing . You 're gon na find that out when the time comes . Until then leave me alone . - You want a lift or not ? - Yeah , sure . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . Why ? - You 've hardly said a word . - You 're right . I 've been thinking . - About us ? - Myself . That 's selfish . Honey , do you think I 'm a brave man ? - What a funny question to ask . - Well , do you ? I do n't know . Why ? - I 've got to prove something to someone . - Who ? You do n't know him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're brave . That helps . You do n't know how much that helps . Let 's not talk about it any more . We should have been talking about ourselves all this time , what 's going to happen to us . - What do you want to happen ? - I want to marry you . I want that , too . Funny , we barely know each other . We see each other for what seems only moments . And yet ... I know what you mean . - Choynski , not going to the wedding ? - No . I 'd better get a transfer . I ca n't learn this bayonet business . I 'm all thumbs . - On guard . - No , Sarge , not again ! - I 'm not well from the last time . - On guard ! - Play that thing again . You lead . - What ? You lead ! Shift your weight . Left , left ! There . Keep it up . You 'll get the knack of it . Practise that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I got it ! I have n't been in church since I was 14 . - Kissing the bride 's a great invention . - Sure makes me homesick . - What 's the matter ? - He looks the same . - How do you expect him to look ? - Married , wrinkled , worried , like me . - 44 hours and 34 minutes left . Go ! - Excuse me , sports . Here 's your wedding present from the gang . You 've all been wonderful . - Are you sure you 've got the right guy ? - I 'm sure . Come on , get going ! - " Sempre felice " , Mac ! - Keep the situation well in hand , Pete ! We got 44 hours and 33 minutes . What are we gon na do ? Al , if I was a girl , I 'd marry you . Knock it off ! I 've had a hard day . What am I doing ? 44 hours and 32 minutes . That is n't very long , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes . Lots I guess . - We 'll make it seem a long time . - Years . - Shall I open it ? - Sure , go ahead . They 're in a hurry ! Others were in a hurry . The order said move out and the Marines moved out . 11 days at sea . Destination ? Only the top brass knew . Though , of course , scuttlebutt knew the answer , a hundred answers , all wrong . Boat Squad ... halt , one , two ! Dismissed ! Too bad you could n't see her again . You did n't get long . We knew it might happen . I 'll be back . I 've got to believe that . - Sure . We 'll all be back . - Gangway ! That 's no way to carry a flag , Regazzi . I 've got to teach you everything . Now watch this ... What are you gon na do with this , Benny ? I 'm gon na put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times Square . - There is n't any Times Square in Tokyo . - There will be when I get there . Now that 's the way to fold a flag , with the blue field showing . What do you know ! - You got my shirt ! - It 's my shirt ! - I 'm telling you , it 's my shirt ! - It 's my shirt ! Here , fellas . You 'd better quit fighting so much . If you do n't , one of you 's apt to get hurt . Corpsman ! Corpsman ! - What 's that ? - Relax . It 's the Navy clearing its throat . Sure do n't sound like no squirrel gun . I hope they practise real good . What island do you think we 're aiming at ? We 'll get word . - Here it is . - It looks like a pork chop . - What 's its name ? - Tarawa . Never heard of it . It 's the wrong place . It 's part of an atoll called Tarawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask me how you spell it . You 'll have to stick your faces into it but you do n't have to spell it . - This is Red Beach Three . That 's us . - What have they got there ? Everything . This island 's held by a special naval landing force . That means Japanese marines . They 're dug in and they 're mean . They 'd just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox , but that 's all right . Let the other guy die for his country . You 'll live for yours . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Get over there . - I can hear him . Get over there . I do n't want anybody hurt because you did n't listen . - Schoolteacher , do me some homework . - What 's your problem , son ? Put down 5,000 . Scuttlebutt says that 's how many Nips are on that rock . - The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells . - Do n't forget the fly-fly boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now add the tons of explosives , divide it by the Nips and get the answer . - Maybe we 'll be back for noon chow . - Do n't figure that way . The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in . When we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon-coloured guys waiting . Only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach . You 've heard the naval foray 's a waste of time and metal . Stryker knows better . - Who cut you in on this conversation ? - You say when I can and ca n't talk ? - Just when you ca n't talk to me . - Knock it off , Conway . I 've had enough of your " hardbitten sergeant " attitude . You 're so big everybody 's been afraid to take a punch at you . I 'm not ! Cool off ! Forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach . - Do n't expect any soft touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to your debarking stations ! All right , men , sound off when your name 's called . Now hear this , there 'll be no movies tonight ! The place is opened up for business . - Missed ! - Maybe they 're firing blanks . - Maybe a two-headed kid 's aiming . - Maybe this is just manoeuvres . Get out now . We 're crossing the line of departure . Lock and load ! - Good luck , Sarge ! - Charlie , give me a hand here ! Lieutenant , hit the deck ! How is it ? I got hit ! Corpsman ! You 'll be all right . They got us pinned down ! We ca n't get over these logs ! - I 'm going while I can ! - Stay here , kid ! We 're gon na be killed here . I 'd like to get at them ! Why rush ? This is a nice place . - They got the lieutenant ! - They 'll get all of us if we do n't move . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we train to take it lying down ? - Sarge , do something about it !

All these bombs and they 're still killing us . - Smoke , sir ? - Thanks . I 've sent for flame-throwers to assist . Your squad will support . Follow me ! You heard ! Move out and stay down !

Next time do n't be in such a hurry . - You 're across , ai n't you ? - Across what ? To where ? - I 'm running low on ammo . - I am too . Forgot about that . We got ta get some more . - I 'll go . - Wait ! Pick a number from one to six . - Two . - Five . You 're both wrong . That guy kills me .

Major Crowe says the Nips have been filtering into these tank traps . Disperse your squad along this section . Tell your men there 's to be no smoking , no moving or unnecessary talking . If they find out how thin we are , they can get to the beach . That 's a platoon area . All I got 's a beat-up squad , short three men . - Could n't you ... ? - Can I give you three men ?

Corpsman ! - Stryker ! - Get down and stay down ! - You had your orders ! - Somebody 's wounded ! - Quiet . - Let 's get him ! Stay down ! It may be an old Jap trick .

Tarawa was officially declared secure at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle .

I 'll give somebody $5 to shoot me in the foot . - I 'll do it for $2.50 . - You 're too willing ! Some replacements out here assigned to our squad . We build up the joint and they come and live in it . This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh . He 's Fowler . Mike McHugh , from Cedar Rapids to see this war 's over in a hurry . - How old are you ? - Nineteen . - How old ? - Well , eighteen ... going on eighteen . We heard that the squad leader 's tough . - There are rumours to that effect . - Tough sergeants roll off my knife ! You 're gon na find your first few days with Sergeant Stryker very interesting . You new men come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? - Certified fit for duty , so the medics say . - Good . The replacements came up with me . They get younger all the time . - Or we 're getting older . - Or both . - I can stand having you back . - I can stand being back . What happened to the squad , besides the Greek , Shipley and Thomas ? Choynski ... Thomas ? He never got a scratch . - I was sure he got it . - Why ? When we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo . Never came back . How long between the time he went back and you got overrun ? About 40 minutes . 40 minutes ? Stay here . Thomas ! - Yeah ? - Outside . - What 's that about ? - Do n't ask me . I have n't any spies . - That 's far enough . - What 's this about ? Just that I hate your guts ! Get up . You doped off and got one of my men killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough . Get up ! - Stryker ... Attention ! All right , break it up . - What 's your name ? - Sergeant Stryker . Able Company , sir . And you ? Pfc Thomas . Able Company , sir . This may take some explaining before a court martial . Help that man up . - You 'll need medical attention . - I 'll be OK , sir . That 's debatable . You know it 's not permissible for an NCO to strike a man ? - Yes , sir . - Who struck the first blow ? Colonel , there was n't any first blow struck exactly . A simultaneous explosion perhaps ? Judo , sir . The sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold . No more judo exhibitions . Understand , Sergeant ? Aye , aye , sir . At least you 're no stool pigeon . Wait a minute , Stryker . I 'm wrong , dead wrong . I know it . I doped off for some coffee , but I did n't think a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now , but I did n't then . It 's killing me . I ca n't sleep . A hundred times I wanted to tell you , tell somebody . I ... I liked that Greek ... I 'd do anything for him . If I could I 'd change him for me right now . I think you would . Guys make mistakes but every one we make , a stack of chips goes with it . We make a mistake and some guy do n't walk away ! For evermore he do n't walk away . I guess all we can do is just take it ... and hope we do n't make the same mistake again . I wo n't . Let 's get back . Mail call ! First Platoon . A letter from my wife after 18 months . Know where she is ? In England , entertaining troops . Entertaining troops ? Why is n't she here entertaining me ? I 'm a troop . " They 're all such nice boys . There 's a lieutenant here ... " A lieutenant ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ! I put on muscle lately ! Darling , this is a funny way for a man to find out he 's a father , but you are . It happened the day before yesterday , just in time for breakfast . He 's a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you . I should have told you it was going to happen , but I did n't want to worry you . I do n't know what to call him . We never discussed that . - I 'm a father ! Hey , I 'm a father ! - Let 's see ! - I 'm a father ! - All right , let 's fall in ! Come on ! Finally we got our leave . Ten days in Honolulu . All of us were out on the town . All except Stryker . He was still the same . - Lonesome ? - Drift . - Whiskey . - Two ? - Please . - OK . Thanks . A drink 'll be good . I 'm tired . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , Sergeant . - Right . - Thanks . 65 cents for a drink . It 's too much . They cheat servicemen . We could drink cheaper at my house . Do n't throw your arm out of joint . Thanks for the drink . I did n't mean to make too much buzzing in your ear . It 's all right , finish your drink . - I did n't mean to sound so tough . - I know . You 're just unhappy . Me , too . My name 's Mary . The long arm of coincidence , or something . Her name , too . That invitation still hold ? Make yourself comfortable . I 'll fix us a drink . Oh , dear ! Well , I can get us some more in a jiffy . I see . Will a sawbuck do it ? Go on , take it . It 's only paper . Well , I 'll be right back . - I hope this is your brand . - Any brand is mine . - She says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marines . Mummy 's fixing you something . Her boy 'll be quiet while she has company . Knock it off ... Where 's his father ? Gone . Well , I guess into each life a little rain must fall . There are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war . You know about babies . Yeah , I know about babies . So long , Mac . - Wait ! - I ca n't spend it on a coral reef . - You 're a very good man . - You 'll get odds on that in the Marines . So long . So long , Sergeant . I 'll pray for you . Let 's not get religion . - I 'll pray for you , Sergeant ! - Good luck . You got a lot of bloodhound in you , Charlie , but you can call off the dogs . I 'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago . Catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ! - Thanks ! - Two bourbon and ice . - A baby 's a big event . - Conway ! - Treating the boys ? - Crack open the hatch ! That 's great . A fellow always gets more kick out of a boy , I guess . I got a kid . Sam , I named him ... after your old man . Wait till he gets to be ten and does n't write . You 'll be mad enough to hit him . No , I wo n't , Stryker , because he wo n't have to write . I 'll be where he is . And I wo n't insist that he be tough . I 'll try to make him intelligent . And I wo n't insist that he read the Marine Corps manual . I 'll get him Shakespeare . I do n't want him to be a Colonel Conway or Sergeant Stryker . I want him to be intelligent , considerate , cultured and a gentleman . - You 're out of line , kid . - Let him be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I intend to exercise that right . - I do n't like you , Stryker . - Let 's talk sense for a minute , Conway . I ca n't have friction in the squad . I 've tried every approach to you that I know . Got nowhere . You 're intelligent ... Do n't patronise me . Your opinion of my IQ does n't interest me in the least . Let 's get this straight . On duty I jump when you holler . Off duty I exercise my God-given rights under a democracy and dislike whom I please . Do we understand each other ? - Beat it . - Come on , you guys , let 's go . I do n't understand why you do n't belt him . - Mellow in my old age , I guess . - Too bad . " Screaming Sam " could n't be proud of him . He could . There 's something inside a guy , always proud of a kid . - Two more ? - Not for me . - I 'll sail again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer me home ? - Charge ! Pull pins ! Prepare to throw ! Throw ! - All right , fifth relay ! - What an arm ! Pick it up ! Right in the groove ! - Look , boy , this is a live grenade . - Gee ! - You know what they can do ? - Yes , sir . Right hand . Wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade . - Got it ? - Yes , sir . Ready ? Pull pin ! Prepare to throw ! Throw ! Grenade ! Hit the deck ! When will you wake up ? You wan na see her again , keep your mind on your work ! - What happened here ? - Little accident , sir . You 're wounded . Corpsman ! - Yes , sir . - Take care of the sergeant . Come right over here , Sergeant . You may not know it , but you just got your life saved . You 'll get a medal . Again the word came and the Marines moved out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time we were a sound fighting unit , blooded and trained . Tarawa had blooded us . Stryker had trained us . - Now , I 'll show you something . - What you got there ? - What does it look like ? - A flag . - What are you gon na do with it ? - Occupy this island in the USA 's name . - You think we 'll have an easy time ? - You got me with you . - Maybe we need two of you . - One was enough in Tarawa . Stick with me . I 'm a battle-hardened veteran . Know how many Japs I knocked off in Tarawa ? 32 . Did I get anything for it ? I got enemies in Washington . If the Marines did n't have me , they 'd never have made it . Now , this is how you fold a flag ! Do you believe in intuition ? Yeah ... in women . Why ? It 's hard to explain . I 've a feeling I 'm not coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't help it . It 's the way I feel . - Why ? I do n't know . It 's like a voice in my ear . I ca n't shake the feeling off . Take my advice , shake it off . No dice . When things like that get in you , it 's no use trying to fight them . If a marine waits long enough he gets the word . Our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea . This island is volcanic and sandy . It 's five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide . This mountain here is a dead volcano . It 's called Suribachi . There 's nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20,000 Japs . The Army Air Corps B-24s have been bombing this place for 62 days . - Maybe it 'll be an easy operation then . - We ca n't be sure . Every yard is covered by some kind of fire . There are two possible landing beaches , one on the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coastline is cliffs . They 'll try and keep us off the beaches . If they do n't , they 'll try and catch us at this first airfield , between the heights of Suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north . They 'll shell us from both sides . Nobody knows what they 've got on this island . But they 've had 40 years to put it there . Saipan was our last stop . The men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to LS Ts . A few more days at sea and the time for landing came . Saddle up ! Skip along and into the amtracs . Anyway , it 's a good day for it . - It 's cold . - Stick around , it 'll get warm . Yeah , that 's what I 'm afraid of . Hey , look ! - Driver , you the joker that wrote that ? - " Semper fi " , Mac ! We should take you in along with us . Hey , McHugh 's going in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ! So ? The kid 's a reader . That should n't worry a dope like you .

Aleychem shalom . - Sarge , I 'm scared . - So am I . - Not you ! - Fowler , I 'm always scared . Line of departure ! Get down ! Lock and load ! Drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach ! All right , hit the beach ! It ai n't Brooklyn ! If this place was a blanket I 'd pull it over my head ! This is the poorest soil I ever saw . What does anyone want an island like this for ? - That 's war . - What 's war ? Trading real estate for men . When God made the world , he must have put all the rubbish left over here . Corpsman ! Corpsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place they got me before ! Getting shot for this ! They 're sure pouring it into Suribachi . Not enough .

Your platoon 's been hit hard . What 's left has been assigned to me . - Yes , sir . - Naval gunfire lifts at 1100 . Stand by . Aye , aye . Move out ! Keep your distance ! - Go on , go on ! - Corpsman ! Corpsman ! Corpsman ! Spread out ! Dig in ! - Dunne , where 's my brother ? - Back there . He 's hit . Flynn ! That 's enough !

You never know what 's happening . Listen . - It 's a tank . - Yeah , but whose ? Ours ! It 's Regazzi . Pillbox at 2 o'clock . OK , give ' em a hot foot ! Thanks , Mac . - I could n't find a bazooka . - You did all right . Saddle up ! No one had ever seen anything like it . No one would have believed it possible .

I ca n't find the words . Two universities and you ca n't find the words to say you were out of line ? - OK , I 'm out of line . - No , you were . There 's a difference . We 'd better get some sack time . Wan na sleep first or watch ? - I 'll watch . - OK . Everybody gets out of line once in a while . Thanks , gyrene .

I 've known a million guys that have heard it . Most of them make it . A few do n't .

For the next two weeks , I wo n't think about anything ... except the eternal struggle between man and the fish . I 've been promised a vacation . You remember ? Sorry , Hank , that 's out . Phil , look at me . College degree , lovable personality ... and I spend most of my time in prison . An undercover specialist . Eight sentences in five years . Dannemora , Sing Sing , Leavenworth ... I joined the department to put criminals behind bars ... and here I am , stir crazy . Read this . Who checks confessions in Springfield ? Every rookie knows Scratch Morton went underground after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a two-bit prison stretch ? - Maybe ? - Maybe ? A hoodlum turns himself in on a phony rap ... and beats the gas chamber . I 'll bet you he 's thumbing his nose at Uncle Sam now and loving it . Jarrett outsmarted you . That 's just what we want him to think . We 're working with the Springfield police . We arranged for the confession to check . So , what happens ? Jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary . In case he 's lonely , wants to talk to someone ... we 'll let one of our boys do a stretch right in the same cell . Still going fishing , Hank ? Yeah . In what prison ? You 'll enjoy the food there . Wonderful chef . - Arrested him myself . - Okay , what 's the pitch ? You 'll be committed to the penitentiary in Illinois . You 'll be one of Jarrett 's cellmates . Stick with him until you find out ... where he unloaded $300,000 in federal currency ... without a single bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very special fence ... that engineered this deal . How does he operate ? Buys stolen money here , 30c , 40c on the dollar . Peddles it on the European black market for who knows how much . No questions asked . Sweet racket . In step with the times . That 's your assignment . I would n't ask you to do another undercover job ... if we were n't up against it . Hello , Hank . Prison records from Illinois . Your new buddies . Busy little place , is n't it ? 2,700 of the roughest and toughest . A few who might recognize you . Let 's go to work . - Find another old client ? - Yeah . Red Draper . Questioned him in ' 46 about a warehouse job . That makes two for transfer . Better run through the arrest once more . I 'll be picked up at a joint known as Tom 's Hideaway . Bill 's Hideaway . On what seems like an ordinary hood roundup . I 'm spotted as a lamister . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the floor , I 'm meek as a baby . - How do I get information out to you ? - Visiting days . Mother again ? Wife this time . One thing though . This time , get me somebody with a good memory . I had a lot of trouble with my " mother " in San Quentin . This time , we 'll get you a girl in the bureau who 's a memory expert . I 'm partial to blondes . Well , who is n't ? As soon as I pick her , I 'll send you a picture . - We move this guy . - Who is he ? Bo Creel . Arrested him two years ago . Wait a minute . We do n't have to worry about him . Finishes his stretch Saturday . He 'll be out before you 're sentenced . Good . Bo Creel would know me in the dark . This job is n't going to be like any of the others , Hank . You see , there 's insanity in the Jarretts . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an institution . I 've had a few strange cellmates in my time ... but this sounds like the jackpot . When he was a kid , he used to fake headaches ... to get his mother 's attention away from the rest of the family . It worked . As he grew up , the fancied headaches became real ... until now they tear him to pieces . Any minute , he 's apt to crack open at the seams . There goes our case . So you 'll be working against time . Suits me . Quicker the better . Except that Cody 's not easy to get close to in a hurry . The only person he 's ever cared about or trusted is his mother . No one else has ever made a dent , not even his wife . His mother 's been the prop that 's held him up . He 's got a fierce psychopathic devotion for her . All his life , whenever he got in a spot ... he just put out his hand , and there was Ma Jarrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old man . You mean I 'm supposed to take mama 's place ? Never can tell . He might need someone . I 'll practice up on my lullabies . Nothing else here . Good . Let 's run through your background again . Born Detroit , March 23 , 1919 . State reform school , 1934 , vandalism . Arrested : Suspicion , grand larceny , Portland , 1939 . Good . The State of Illinois v . Arthur Cody Jarrett . Arthur Cody Jarrett , on your own admission ... you have been convicted of the robbery of the Palace Hotel on October 12 . It is now my duty to pronounce sentence . For the crime of grand larceny , you are hereby sentenced to serve ... not less than one and not more than three years ... in the state penitentiary . The State of Illinois v . Victor Pardo . How is he ? Tough ? With Big Ed giving the orders now , there 'll be all kinds of fireworks . He 's got plans that 'll make the old Jarrett mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parker moves his lips pretty good . It 's about Big Ed . What 'd he say ? He 's the number one boy now , Parker says . In more ways than one . - What was that crack ? - I could n't read him , Cody . - Was that about my wife ? - Honest , he had his mouth covered . Maybe a kick in his skull would do him some good . They got rules in this chicken coop . You start anything , you 'll wind up in a hole . Did I ask you for any advice ? Look , Pardo , I 've been watching you ... and up till now , you have n't done anything I can put my finger on . Maybe that 's what bothers me . I do n't know you , and what I do n't know , I do n't trust . To me , you 're a face and a number , and let 's keep it that way . When I want your help , I 'll ask for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following new men report to the dispensary for shots . Abbott , Jordan , Bacon , Pardo , Butler ... Jenkins , Jarrett , Williams , Phillips . Hughes , Russell . Keep it moving , boys . No talking . Well , if it ai n't Bo Creel . Boys in L.A . Had a coming-out party . It was planned for you a month ago . I 'm packing , and bang , flat on my back with pneumonia . The doc 's checking me out today . See you in eight years . Hyde , Frank . - Keep moving , boys . No talking . - Jacoby , George . All right , move up . Jarrett , Arthur Cody . I 'm leaving tomorrow , Cody . - Anything I can do for you on the coast ? - Yeah , look up Big Ed . - Tell him I was asking for him . - Johnson , Bate . Holden , John . Get the lead out . Coon , Fred . Scared , sonny ? Break it up over there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's nuts . A couple months in solitary will cool you off , bugger . Fisher . Maddox . Pardo . I 'm awfully sorry , my good man . But Mr . Pardo is still on vacation . His month 's up today . It is , huh ? That 's cozy . Look at what they left out of this one . It must have been a lulu before the warden got it . - Hey , Herbert . - Yeah . Any chance you get , read Pardo , will you ? - Why ? - Read him . Maybe on visiting days . That 's when they loosen up . What do you have against him , Cody ? Pardo 's all right . Did n't I check his record up at the dispensary ? That 's only a record . What else do we know about him ? Maybe that envelope will tell us something . Think you ought to ? That 's U.S . Mail . I 'm a U.S . Citizen , ai n't I ? Not lately . Wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't get a chance to . Nice . We 'll put it right over here where we can see it . He 'll know we 've been in his mail . All right . So he 'll know . Be a nice surprise when he gets out of solitary . Hi , kid . Let me shake the hand that slugged Roy Parker . Why did you do it , Pardo ? You know they got rules in this joint , do n't you ? Yeah . Maybe I did n't want to get my shots . I guess his eyes ai n't so good after solitary . All right , what 's the gag ? What 's she done to herself ? Had the best-looking blonde I ever saw . When my back 's turned , she 's a brunette . Do n't even look like her anymore . Maybe she 's hot . Whenever I changed my hair , so did my missis . She better be a blonde when I get out of here . Yeah . Too bad your little trick did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shots anyway . Yeah , Benny . Parker 's shooting his mouth off again . Told Benny your boys pulled a caper . - How much did they get ? - $57,000 . - Are you in for any of it ? - Full share . No kidding ? What 's being in here got to do with it ? They 're his boys . What they get , he gets . Yeah . Ma sees to that . Get one thing clear , all of you . Anything we get ... Cody 's in for his full share . That 's how it is . Anyone thinks different ... say so now ... or would you rather wait till Cody gets out ? Well , any argument ? Het ? Cotton ? Happy ? Ed ? How come , Big Ed ? You 're the one I expected to give trouble . Fair is fair . We are n't gon na forget Cody after all he did for us . Cody 'll be real grateful to you . Where do you think you 're going ? To pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's getting late . Het , tell Verna I want her back in here . - What 's eating you , sugar ? - You and your big ideas . That 's all they are . Ideas . " You and me belong together , sugar . Just leave it to Big Ed . " I 'm sick of waiting for you to make your move . You 're as scared of Cody as any of them . He 's still Mr . Big , in prison or out . - What makes you think so ? - You . Fair is fair , is it ? That 's quite a beef you put up about Cody being in on the cut . See , a guy who thinks his pals are taking care of him ... he gets kind of careless . What does that mean ? Alive , Cody gets out in one , two years , maybe . Dead , he gets out sooner . Dead ? Right now , he 's a sitting duck up there in that pen . He 's rubbing elbows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed ? When I say so . Where 's Pardo ? You know all about radios . Maybe you can fix the warden's . - I 'll fix it so it blows up in his face . - Suits me . Come on . Back to your places . Go ahead . Get on back there . Are you hurt , Jarrett ? No . Things were getting kind of dull around here , anyway . Back to your work . You , too , Pardo . - The lever slipped . - You can tell that to the warden later . I saw that just in time . What do you want ? A medal ? You would have looked like that barrel . You almost walked into it yourself . Why should you care if a guy named Cody Jarrett gets his ... if you do n't want something ? Okay . Keep your medal . Come on , break it up . Get going , Jarrett . Sorry , Cody . Forget it , Parker . Accidents will happen . Attention . The following men have visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phillips , Jordan . Hello , Ma . Cody . You been hurt . - Oh , it 's nothing . Just an accident . - You sure ? What kind of question is that ? Why are you nervous ? Anything wrong ? - Plenty . - Like what ? That 's why I come . I 'm the one to tell you . It 's Big Ed and Verna . They run out . It 's my fault , Cody . I let you down . I said I 'd take care of things and I let you down . I saw it coming , but I did n't think he 'd have the guts . Forget it , Ma . It was in the cards for Big Ed to make his try . Do n't you care ? Sure . What 's mine is mine , but I ai n't gon na let it make me sick . I 'll take care of them when I get out . That 's what I told myself . I 'll help you , Cody , like always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . When you 're around , Ma , nothing can stop me . That 's right . Only you got to be careful about Big Ed . If I know Big Ed , right now he 's doing enough worrying for the both of us . Maybe not . Ca n't expect me to come looking for him . That 's what I 'm getting at . When you get out ... he knows his life is n't worth a plugged nickel . When a tinhorn like that thinks he 's big enough to take your place ... he 's got to feel pretty safe . Now , all of a sudden , he makes his move ... like he was sure you 'd never get out of here ... except in a box . I see what you mean . You said it was an accident ? For a minute , I thought it was . How 'd it happen ? A pal of Big Ed 's dropped something . You see , Cody ? I was right . He was figuring you 'd be dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? If he tried it once , he 'll try it again . I 'll still walk out of this joint , and then I 'll take care of Big Ed . And let him live that long ? No , Cody . I 'll take care of Big Ed . No , Ma . You wo n't have a chance . Any time I ca n't handle his kind , I 'll know I 'm getting old . No one does what he 's done to you , son , and gets away with it . No , Ma . Look , listen to me . You wo n't have a chance . I 'm going after him to keep him from having you knocked off here . - I 'm telling you , do n't do it . - Goodbye , Cody . Ma ! Keep your hands off that wire . What 's the matter , Parker ? I ai n't going to do anything . Not now . I 'm going to let you stay awake nights ... sweat it out . Then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you back . I 'll take care of Big Ed . I 'll take care of him , Cody . What 's the matter , Cody ? My head . Cover for me . Watch it . Fingers are kind of thick today . No doctors . It 's all right now . He 's gone . - Where 's the pain ? - It 's right here . Do n't let it beat you . You are a top man , are n't you ? Since I was a kid , I 've been reading about you . Always hoping I could join up with you . You do n't want to let those two-bit mugs see Cody Jarrett on his knees . Come on . - You all right , Cody ? - Yeah . - Just ca n't sleep , that 's all . - That headache gone ? - Yeah . - Then why ca n't you sleep ? It 's Ma . She 's walking into trouble . - Anything I can do ? - No . Yeah . Maybe there is , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this penny-ante stretch ... would be a kind of vacation ... take the heat off me for another job . Sometimes you make plans , sometimes they do n't work out . Then you got to get doing and fast , you understand ? - I got business on the outside . - Going to crash out ? Yeah . Want to come along ? Maybe I do . Did you tell anybody else ? Figured on cutting in Tommy Ryley . Then you 'll have to cut in 10 more . Why do you want Ryley ? He 's got a gun stashed . Do n't need a gun . They 're not gon na open the gates for us . You think you 're the only guy in this paw that wants out ? What do you think I 've been dreaming about nights ? I got a way to get a mile from here before anybody knows what hit them . Without artillery , it ca n't be done . No ? Listen , I 'm a pretty handy fella with electricity , you remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know what that means ? I have a slight idea . The generators control everything : Searchlights , gun turret , main gate . Who needs artillery ? Only we got to do it alone . We 're going to need a car . My wife 's coming tomorrow . We 'll set it all up . All right , kid . It 's a deal ... and if it works , I 'll pay you back . Maybe you 'll give me that medal . Solid gold . Good news for you , Herbert . You 've had good news for the last 12 years . I 'm working on a plan to get your case reviewed . - Hello , Margaret . - You 're looking well , Vic . We 're being watched . Say anything you like and make it good . Listen to me carefully . Divorce ? Vic , you ca n't mean that . Why ? What have I done ? That 's fine . Jarrett 's getting out of here and I 'm going with him . I know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that 'll break my heart . It might be better for you . It 's my life . Let me decide what to do with it . Just the two of us . Tell Evans we 'll break out Thursday night . Tell him to plant a getaway car with an oscillator . Can you remember that ? With an oscillator . I 'll remember , darling . - Everything clear ? - Perfectly clear . You wo n't be sorry , Vic . When you get out , we 'll be happy . I 'll see to that . Nice . Where 'd you learn all that ? Soap opera ? How did you know ? This time I 'm going right to the top to get you out . - Herbert , are you listening ? - Sure , Jerry . But if that fails , you 'll have to serve the rest of your term . Jerry , you could n't get me out of here if I was pardoned . All right , this is the prison . We place the getaway car in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up to the battery . Our cars will be parked here , a mile or so away , one here and the other here . We assume that Jarrett and Hank come out here somewhere . They pile into the getaway car , and they 're off . - You ready , Ernie ? - Ready . The transmitter wavelength is 47.1 . 47.1 . All right . Switch it on . Our receivers pick up that sound from the oscillator ... which enables us to cross-plot their exact position . For example ... suppose the impulse received here ... has a bearing of 210 degrees . This one here reads 45 degrees . We plot them like so . Where the lines cross , that 's where they are . It does n't matter how far they travel . As long as our cars are within receiving distance ... we can tell where they are . Switch it off . How far is receiving distance ? We had a dry run on a car yesterday . Kept tabs on him for 20 miles . That little thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll show you how . When you 've got a week to spare , Ernie 'll tell you all about electronics . We 'll meet at the airport in 40 minutes . Be in Springfield late this afternoon . Tonight . Is n't that Lefeld down there ? Nat Lefeld ? From the coast mob . Came in today . They checked him in today ? Ask him how my mother is . Ask about Cody 's mother . She 's dead . Dead ? I want to get out of here ! Get me out ! Special for Jarrett . - Hiya , Doc . - Hi , Ryley . Hi , Cody . Brought you some grub . Hot soup made special . How are you , Vic ? Glad to see you , kid . You 're a good boy , Vic . It 's me , Tommy Ryley . That 's right , Vic . Play it smart . Play it smart . That 's the only way it 'll work . Here , get some of this into you . Next time you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about it , Vic . Bring the gun . You sure you wo n't try some of this delicious soup ? I 'll get it if you take me along , Cody . I do n't want any of that slop . Try it on the warden . It 's a deal . If you do n't want it , I guess you do n't want it . But you got ta keep up your strength , fella . If the warden do n't want it , try it on the governor . Guess he ai n't hungry . Dr . Simpson speaking . Yes , Warden . I 've just finished my report on Jarrett . Violent , homicidal . He 'll probably have recurrent periods of normal behavior , but ... Yes , sir . Our psychiatrists are coming tonight . They 'll commit him to the institution . Yes , Warden . I suggest you prepare the release for him . Thank you , Warden . - Oscillator all ready ? - Ready to sing , Phil . Put the car in the trees . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telephone , Mr . Evans . - All right . Hold it , boys . Evans speaking . Hello , Warden . That is bad news . Not altogether a surprise . Thanks for your cooperation anyway , Warden . Say , by the way , tomorrow there 'll be a pardon coming through ... for one of your inmates , Vic Pardo . Rush it through , will you ? Thanks . No dice , boys . The party 's off . Jarrett 's a raving maniac . They 've got him in a straitjacket . It 's a good thing for Hank it happened inside instead of out . It 's the only good thing about it . Take the oscillator off the car . I 'll get the plane tickets for 10:00 tonight . You have a car to take us to the Springfield airport ? It 'll be there , Mr . Evans . Sorry , boys . They ca n't all work out . How would you like a little change of scenery , Cody ? Someplace where we might be able to cure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you ? No . Might do me some good . - Doctor . - Not now , Ryley . I want something to eat . - You 've sent away two meals already . - That 's why I 'm hungry now . Hunger 's always a hopeful sign . Nobody feeds Cody Jarrett . What am I , a kid ? Is it all right to remove the straitjacket , Doctor ? I 'll do it . They got you tied up good . The examination 's over . All right , turn around . Now , keep them quiet . Doctor , you 're with me . I want you to make a little phone call for me . And no slip-ups , or you 're gon na need a doctor . You 're taking a little walk , boys . Doc wants you in the dispensary . Wait here . - Come on , Parker . - Where to ? Dispensary . Special invitation to the doctor . Here . Tie and gag him . Drop that stick . Now . Get in the cell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tuxedo with you . Reader , cover the outside door . We 'll not make it this way . We 'll never get to the gate . - Who says so ? - Why me ? What do you want with me ? You 're my pal . I 'm taking you with me . Come on . - Look ... - Get . You got me wrong . I got nothing against you . It was Big Ed . He told me to do it . You would n't kill me in cold blood , would you ? I 'll let you warm up a little . There 's the fingerprint that nailed me . Psycho , put that zoot suit on him . - Me ? - Yeah , you . Cody , my way , there would n't be no shooting . Ai n't gon na be any my way either . We 're going out of here in a car like gentlemen on a picnic . They want me to take a little trip . We 're gon na take a trip . Only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get . Pick up those hats . Everybody down . Ryley , get those keys . You get in the trunk . Come on , get it open . Get in . Ryley , you get in the front . Reader , get in the back and make like you 're loony . And you , you drive . You know how jittery I am . Any minute I 'm liable to explode . Now if we do n't make it , I 've got six slugs in this gun . One for each of us . - Dr . Harris . - Good night , Doc . Hello . Yeah , speaking . What ? All right . Right away . Turn back . Jarrett 's busted out . Black sedan . Probably headed southwest . Following are the names of the men who escaped with Cody Jarrett . Thomas Ryley , Roy Parker , Michael Curtin , Vic Pardo . Do not shoot unless absolutely necessary . Hostages in car . Do not shoot ... - One break for our boy . - What 's Hank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets what he 's after . I like your tailor . How do you like mine ? Tommy , rustle up some grub . You , in there . Vic , what 's taking you so long ? Trying to find some more artillery . - Let it ring . - Someone might get suspicious . Come on . How you doing , Parker ? It 's stuffy in here . I need some air . Stuffy , huh ? I 'll give you a little air . No clue to their movements has been reported ... since their assault last night on a service station ... north of Gallup , New Mexico . It is assumed now by federal law enforcement agencies ... that Jarrett and the other escaped convicts are heading for California . This concludes the nightly news summary from KFKL , San Bernardino . Did you check the windows ? - I said , " Did you check the windows ? " - Ed , let 's get out of here . Take it easy , baby . We 're ready for him when he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listening , going crazy . It ai n't like waiting for some human being who wants to kill you . Cody ai n't human . Fill him full of lead , and he 'll still come at you . Plug him and he drops , same as anybody else . The boys did n't think so . Why did they beat it down to San Berdoo ? ' Cause they know this is between me and Cody . - They 'll be back when it 's over . - You 'll be dead . Maybe so . But the time comes when a man 's got ta stop running away and face things . Or else go on running for good . All right , throw your life away . Stay here and shoot it out . Me ? I 'm going . I want to live . Cody might have ideas about that . I 'll go someplace he 'll never find me . The world ai n't big enough , sugar . Not when he finds out what you did to his ma . - You 'd tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Why not ? - But I only did it for you , Ed . She had you covered . Cody still ai n't going to like to hear that she got it in the back . Feel more like staying now ? I said I 'd be back . Now tell me you 're glad to see me . Only say it low , so nobody can hear . Cody , I 'm so glad to see you . I 've been praying you 'd come back . I could n't stand it any longer . I was running away . - From Big Ed ? - Yeah . - What 's the matter ? Do n't you like him ? - No . Maybe you should n't have teamed up with him . I could n't help it , Cody . He said if I did n't go away with him , he 'd have you killed . All I wanted was for you to come back . That 's the truth . I love you , Cody . - You let Ma die ? - No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just stood there and watched Big Ed kill her . I tell you , you got it wrong , Cody . Maybe you thought it was funny , an old woman taking on a guy like that . No . I tried to warn her ... but he caught me and beat me . Then when Ma came , he was waiting for her , and he ... - I ca n't tell you . - Tell me . He got her in the back . - Is he in there now ? - Yeah . But you got ta be careful , Cody . He 's got the house rigged up like a trap . You ca n't get in unless I tell you how . - Ed . - Stay where you are . - What was that bell downstairs ? - It was me , Ed . What were you doing down there ? I could n't go through with it . I tried , but I could n't . Talk sense . I was going to take the car and beat it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . You 're my honey . Still got nerves ? Please , Ed . I feel like a drink . - Fix me one , too . - Here . Catch . Listen , Cody . Ed said this joint is a cinch . - Good for $50,000 . - Who ? - Big Ed . - Never heard of him . Go on . The way we had it figured , Cody , we pile out of the cars here ... we slug the guards , and we grab the payroll here . Blast our way out . It 'll all take 50 seconds . They got cars . They 'd follow you . That 's where we use the gas truck . I 'll stall it right in the gates . And when we beat it in the getaway cars , I got the truck keys in my pocket . And where do you get the gas truck ? We got one stashed behind a barn . Bought it with our own dough . $12,000 . - You bought a gas truck ? - Yeah . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe it ai n't so bad , Cody . $12,000 gets you $50,000 . Fence $50,000 , and you get $20,000 . Then what are you going to do with that ? Buy two more gas trucks ? That joint has got the serial number of every bill . Any guy who says he can fence $50,000 is crazy . - The Trader ai n't crazy . - The Trader ? - Who 's he ? - My manager , kid . Come on . Let 's get a look at that $12,000 doll . Cody . My radio ai n't working again . Oh , no . What do you want it for , unemployment insurance ? Ca n't I go down to San Berdoo and get it fixed ? Nobody leaves unless I say so . Now , you ... What 's the matter , baby ? I 'm not gon na hurt you . Go and read your comic books . Good girl . This fellow you call the Trader ... can you trust him ? Why ? I would n't like to see my share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Suspicious , ai n't you ? - Just careful . You do n't have to worry about the Trader . He pays off on the spot in nice , clean bills . Where does he get rid of this stuff ? - Ships to Europe . Collects both ends . - Smart operator . Did n't see any of that dope from that tunnel job pop up , did you ? I like him better now . Not bad . Maybe the $12,000 do n't go down the drain after all . - Hey , Het . - Yeah . You 're pretty good with a blowtorch . You suppose you could cut a hole in here into the tank ? Yeah , sure . We 're back in business , boys . We 're back in business . And not Big Ed 's way either , and not for $50,000 . But first , a question . Supposing you want to push in a place like Fort Knox ... and grab yourselves a couple of tons of gold ... what 's the toughest thing about a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar for the gentleman on the balcony . Right on the button . Getting in . Which brings me to a story Ma used to tell me when I was a kid . A story about a horse . Way back , there was a whole army trying to knock over a place called Troy ... and getting nowhere fast . Could n't even put a dent in the walls . One morning , the people of Troy wake up , look over the walls ... and the attacking army disappeared . Men , boats , the works . Taking a powder . But they left one thing after them ... a great , big wooden horse . And according to Ma ... Hello , there . I was wondering if I could use your telephone ? There ai n't a phone here for five miles . I 'm sorry to hear that . - Good morning . - Hello . Lost your way , mister ? No . I wanted to call my office ... but these gentlemen say you do n't have a phone here . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll show you where it is . Thank you very much . There 's a call that 's gon na cost more than a nickel . Looks like Big Ed 's gon na have company . And we got a new station wagon . - How 's fishing ? - Fine , Cody . - Good catch . - You like the truck idea ? It 's admirable . We might all profit by a closer study of classical literature . Chemical plant . I guess that 's Long Beach way . That 's close enough for now . You know the way I work . I must ask that you do n't insist on knowing the exact location ... until you 've reached the rendezvous . That 's all right . The only thing that matters is ... how much dough this joint has in the kitty . $426,000 will be placed in their safe before closing time tomorrow ... to be distributed to deserving employees the following morning ... provided there 's no unforeseen accident , of course . - Like me and my boys ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found they went to school together . Maybe they 're buddies after all . Something funny 's going on there . I 've had my eye on this place for several months . Now , these checking gates , that means a pass for the driver ... identity cards and stuff . We 're all hot . Your truck will be driven past these checkers ... by an ex-convict of my acquaintance . He 's now leading a scrupulously honest life ... as a truck driver for this very firm . Smooth . Sorry to bust in . We 're finished out there . Wan na check ? I 'll be right out . - You having much luck , mister ? - I have n't started yet ... I 'm just on my way . - Done much fishing up here ? - Every year . - What are you trying for ? - Bass . - This guy 's a phony , Cody . - I beg your pardon ? This is trout country . There ai n't bass for 100 miles . What 's so funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bass . He got you , did n't he ? Trader , this is the kid I 've been telling you about .

My name 's Daniel Winston . San Diego . Securities . Glad to know you , Mr . Winston . Sit down . Hold it . Where you going , Pardo ? - What 's doing , kid ? - I do n't like being pushed around . My orders was nobody was to leave . That might go for hoods like him . When I got a reason to leave , I leave .

When we crashed out , I did n't leave no forwarding address . - It 's the truth , Cody . - Why did n't you ask me ? I figured you might get sore . So you took off on your own . I have n't seen her in a long time . I 'm human , you know , like everyone else . All right , kid . You 're just lonesome . Lonesome like me . You ? - What about ... - You mean Verna ? All I ever had was Ma . Now ... Your mother alive ? No , she died before I even knew her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - That sounds funny to you ? - No . Some might think so . My old lady never had anything . Always on the run , always on the move . Some life . First , it was my old man , died kicking and screaming in a nut house ... then my brother , and after that , it was taking care of me . Always trying to put me on top . " Top of the world , " she used to say . And then , times when I 'd be losing my grip ... there she 'd be , right behind me ... pushing me back up again . And now ... Anyway , she quit running , Cody . Yeah . Quit running . That was a good feeling out there , talking to her . Just me and Ma . A good feeling . I liked it . Maybe I am nuts . Let 's go in and have a drink . Tell you what , Vic . I 've got an idea . We 'll pick up your wife after the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the four of us . No kidding , Cody . That sounds great .

Rubbing shoulders with the best of them . How do you do , Countess ? Sable coats , jewels just dripping from my fingers . I 'd knock their eyes out , Cody . You 'd be real proud of me . Do n't go flipping your lid . He ai n't thought of a vacation in years , Vic . Do n't let him forget it . Here 's to us , top of the world . How 's the radio coming , Verna ? - A crystal set would play better . - Yeah ? Maybe I could fix it for you . I wish you would , Vic . I 'm dead without music . We 'll get a new one . I do n't mind fixing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep anyhow . Anything you say , kid . - I was just gon na throw it away . - I 'm not making any promises . We better hit the hay , Duchess . We got a heavy day tomorrow . - See you in the morning . - Right . Grab the brass ring . What are you doing ? We 're on our way . You 've got to have a chain on the ground , get rid of electricity . That 's only when you got gasoline or chemicals inside . You want to have some traffic cop think you got a load of something else ? That 's using your head , kid . All right , snap it up . You all know what you 're to do ... and you know where the rendezvous is . We 're to pick up our driver there at 5:00 ... and we 'll be at the plant right after the day shift has checked off . Now , Vic and Tommy , we go in the truck . The rest of you go with Verna in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for speeding . But get them there . Do n't worry , honey . I 'll get them there . $12,000 and she 's getting ready to blow up in your face . Might be a cracked radiator . We 'd better stop somewhere . There 's a gas station down the hill , Cody . Pull in and watch yourself . Fill her up ? - With water , bub . Check that radiator . - Okay . - You got a washroom , mister ? - Yeah . Cleanest in the West . Dry as a bone . Go get Vic . Hurry up . - Cody says to hurry up . - All right . I thought you said cleanest in the West . You ever see a cleaner one , mister ? - The mirror 's so dirty you can see double . - What ? Wise guys . Did n't even buy gas . Into the wooden horse , boys . Where do we go , Trader ? You should be back in about three hours . - I 'll wait . - We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a cup of coffee .

There 's a button up in the cab . Press it once if trouble shows , and three times for all clear . Okay . Somebody 's ribbing you , Russ . Take a slant at the mirror in your washroom .

How do you like that , boys ? A copper and his name is Fallon . And we went for it . I went for it . Treated him like a kid brother . And I was going to split 50-50 with a copper . Maybe they 're waiting to pin a medal on him . Solid gold . Come on . Get up . Get your hands up . Yeah , that 's it . A nice gold medal for the copper .

She says she can get Jarrett to come out . If I can , mister , will you go easy on me ? I 'll tell him you 'll let him get away because you do n't want your guy hurt . He 'll believe me . Then , when he comes out , you can do what you want with him . No deal . Lock her up . Cheap copper ! Jarrett , you have n't got a chance . Come out with your hands up .

@@6017201 BIG BEN CHIMES Excuse me , could you tell me the way to Nutbourne College ? You must be the new English master ! Yes . Richard Tassell . My name 's Billings . I teach Maths . The carriage should be without . Hello , Rainbow , old scout ! Aye , aye , sir . How was Mon Repos , Southsea ? Middling , sir . This is mr . Tassell , the new English master . Pleased to meet you . Keep on the right side of Rainbow . He runs the school and knows the country . Black-market whisky , butter , eggs , anything at a price , right , Rainbow ? Times are difficult , sir . Is this your first appointment ? Yes . Ex-service ? Army . Pond interviewed you , I suppose . What did you make of him ? He seemed quite pleasant . He 's bats . You 're going to loathe it here . That 's a fine way of introducing me to it ( ! ) Oh , I see you 've been putting in a spot of work on the garden for a change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been on at me and Edwin all the week . " Clean this up . Paint that . " Has n't given us a moment . Must be expecting a gaggle of parents . There are six cottages in the village , a pub and a post office . We are now entering the main hall of the noble pile . According to history , it goes back to Henry VIII . According to the bank , it goes back to THEM , unless Pond keeps up with his payments . Fine old staircase ... Mmm . ... but you have to climb it 20 times a day . And this is the common room . Haven from howling kids and the back parlour of our domestic life . You 'll find your evenings here rollicking ( ! ) Matthews - he 's the second master - plays a good hand of ecarte . Joue here suffers from insomnia . JOUE SNORES Takes French and he plays backgammon ... when he 's awake . I 'll introduce you to him later . What about you ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bob . It 's led me astray ever since . HORN PLAYS A TUNE - What 's that ? - Hyde-Brown . Known to the natives as Whizzo . He 's the sports master . He 's the only chap who is n't really affected by this place . Oh , I 'm sorry if I 'm painting a gloomy picture . Oh , hello , Ramsden . This is Tassell , the new English master . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? He 's the science master . We call him the Ghost of Nutbourne . Ha ! How are you , Billings , you jaundiced swine ? Oh , had the devil of a journey . Thought I 'd never make it . Nearly ran out of juice .

Winter Cottage run ? Oh , thanks . ... Just my luck . I say , Tassell , you can have this cupboard . What 's that ass Pond been up to ? This place has n't had a coat of paint since they took photographs for the prospectus . I say , you chaps , take a butcher 's at these . This is a little job I ran across in a joint in Montmartre . She comes from Birkenhead actually . The one with the advanced ideas - that 's Jeanne . Wo n't you ever grow up ? I certainly hope not . That 's Yvette . What a scorcher . It 's I'amour , old man .

What is it on the board , Matty . Really , it 's only three yards . Mr . Pond wants to go to tea today . Tea ? ! That 's the first time . What 's the idea ? I have n't the remotest notion . It 's about 5.30 and I saw mrs . Hampstead going in with the tea about two minutes ago . We have no alternative but to investigate this strange phenomenon . Let 's go . Oh , do you want ... wary Willy ? Oh , dear , oh , dear , oh , dear ! And before term 's started . Monsieur Joue . Wake up , Monsieur Joue . Wake up ! J'aurai , tu auras , il aura ...

POND LAUGHS Excuse me . Tea is served . POND CHUCKLES Mr Tassell . Welcome to Nutbourne . Delighted to have you join us . My colleagues , I 'm sure , will tell you all you need to know about the school . Right , Billings ? Sit down , gentlemen , sit down . Lend me a hand with the tea , will you , Billings , please ? Well , I hope you all enjoyed your vacations . Come in Matthews , Joue . Here we are all once again back in harness . And I , for one , can say that I 'm ... I 'm not sorry . Sit down , Ramsden . Yes , it 's 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the sugar , Billings . 15 years since I came here . And I must say it 's 15 years that I shall look back on with a very deepest affection . There 'll be many more to look back upon before you and Nutbourne part company , sir . I appreciate that sentiment , Matthews . But I 'm afraid it 's a ... a pleasure that may not be granted to me . Oh , come , sir ! Ha-ha , yes ! Are these crumpets ? I do n't know ( ! ) As a matter of fact , that is why I 've asked you all to come here . There is a distinct possibility that I may be translated to a higher sphere . Not your heart again , sir ? My heart is perfectly all right , Billings . No , I 've been urged to consider an appointment elsewhere . No , sir ! Yes , the headmastership of Harlingham . But that 's a decent school . One of the majors . This is a shock . I hardly dare think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a tremendous wrench for me , too , Matthews . Oh ! Crumpets it is . Plates , Billings . But , Matthews , that the call of duty comes before even that of affection . And the call of duty would be stronger at Harlingham , sir ? I have always felt that the highest aim of a teacher is to sow the seeds of knowledge of ever wider , more fertile fields . We 're a comparatively small school here , and judging from recent examination results , not abundantly fertile . Give Joue his tea , will you , Billings , please ? Which brings me to my second point . The governors of Harlingham will shortly be visiting here to study my methods . Then you have n't cornered the job yet , sir ? ! The problem is a mutual one , Billings . Will Harlingham suit me ? Will I be equal to Harlingham ? Mmm , crumpets are nice , sir . Thank you , Matthews . I 'm sure with your co-operation and perhaps a little a little extra effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our school is every bit as good as ... Ramsden . Will you please sit down ? Oh , and bearing this in mind , Mr Joue , do you think you might contrive to spend a little more of the day with us ? Thank you , Joue . And you , Billings ... Billings , do you think you could devote a little more of your time to obtaining class results and a little less to trying to forecast the football variety , hmm ? ! Good . And talking of football , Hyde-Brown , I seem to recall that last year , our first XV lost 11 out of the 12 matches . POND CHUCKLES Might I suggest in your case a little more of the coach , ... a little less of the Coach and Horses ? Oh , I say , that 's a bit of a reflection , is n't it , sir ? Come , come , come ! You must n't think , gentlemen , that I make these comments in a spirit of carping criticism . DOOR OPENS On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mind telling me how many new boys there is this term ? Rainbow , you know better than to interrupt my conferences ! I gave you a note this morning . We 're expecting TWO . You may be expecting two , sir . You 're going to get 102 ! See mr . Matthews about it later and go away now , please ! ... I 'm sorry . " 217 trunks , 217 tuck boxes " , it says here . " Invoice 7348 " , er ... " British Railways " . I 'm not in the least concerned about what the British Railways think it is . It 's a mistake . Take it away and forget about it ! You ca n't hardly forget 217 trunks and tuck boxes , sir . This is worse than teaching algebra to the remove . It 's only on paper , man . On paper ! Take a look a the drive , sir . Drive ? ! 217 trunks and tuck boxes ! Uh ! 217 ? ! Good gracious ! And all correct too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of nationalising the railways . The fellows do n't know their LMS from the Southern Region . Instead of the ordinary muddle , we 've complete chaos . You and Edwin will have to send those trunks ... that do n't belong to us back to the station . How do I know which do n't belong ? Check the register . If there 's any clash about names , you can tell by the initials . Here we have a D Johnson . Now , we have an A Johnson , but no ... But this is addressed to " St Swithin 's , " Nutbourne College , Nutbourne , Hants " . There 's another St Swithin 's here , sir . I suppose this is n't some fourth-form prank ? I do n't offer this as a solution , sir , but a letter came this morning addressed to the Secretary of St Swithin 's . What did you do with it ? I marked it " unknown " , returned it to the Ministry . The Ministry ? ! The Ministry wrote to St Swithin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open it ? Oh , no , of course not . Excuse me , sir , but I may be able to offer a helping hand here , sir . Oh ? You know the postman 's supposed to clear the box in the hall at midday ? Yes , well ? Well , as a result of an arrangement between him and me , I 've been in the habit of taking the post to the village for him . And today you have n't ? Not yet , but , er ... I 've got the key , sir . I see . Then the GPO do n't receive the letters until you hand them over in the village post office . Er ... pub , sir . That poses a pretty problem as to when exactly the letters become the property of the Post Office . It 's not a problem I intend to go into too deeply . " The attached form E.43 should also be signed by a responsible representative of the school whose premises are being shared . " " Whose premises are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ?

" Us . " Date of arrival , 17th September ... " Today . But it ca n't ! I mean , it ca n't ! I 'll get on to this Government department at once . Whitehall 1312 , please . ... If anyone should send a school here without first consulting me - ... it 's outside the bounds of possibility . Shall I stop Rainbow ... taking that luggage to the station ? Certainly not . If the ... Hello , I want to speak to the Schools Resettlement Department , please . I beg your pardon ? But there must be somebody there . Put me on to somebody somewhere else . Nobody ? ! It 's fantastic ( ! ) It 's absolutely fantastic ( ! ) They 've closed the office and gone home . So , at any moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must talk to Mrs Hampstead at once . 100 extra boys . With staff , I presume . Not even a postcard to let us know they 're coming . Nothing we can do about it until I talk to someone in the morning . We 've barely enough space for our own boys . You rang , sir . I did . Mrs . Hampstead , you will prepare to receive 217 boys . Pardon ? 117 of our boys and 100 from another school . I see . The ... the other school will remain for one night only . Now , let me get this clear , sir . I 'm to expect 217 boys tonight ? That 's right . There 's only one way to deal with a crisis like this . First ... What are they going to eat ? Mmm ? Well , they 'll have what we have , of course . Well , if they have it , we wo n't . Do you mind if we deal with first things first ? With small boys - that comes first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in the dormitories , ... so ... we 'll have to find somewhere else . At Harlingham , I 'll be dealing with far greater numbers of boys . This might prove a blessing . That 's one way of looking at it ! Yes ! ... Well , I propose we make a tour of the school . With a little application , we can settle the whole problem . Shall I get Rainbow to unload those trunks ? Oh , yes . I 'd forgotten all about them . Come along , everybody . Oh , Matthews , as to bedding , we 've all those straw palliasses we used in summer camp . I 'll have Rainbow get ' em out . Sir , while you 're running around , I 'll slip down and break the good news to cook . Mrs Hampstead , we are faced with an emergency . I expect the staff to rise to it . They 'll rise all right ( ! ) Good . Phew ! I do n't know how it 's ever going to get as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you to load that lot ? Oh , 25 minutes . Well , you 've got a chance to beat it . You 've got to unload it again . Huh ? St Swithin 's is coming to stay for the night . You 're not speaking in earnest ? That 's the strength of it , sorry . Phew ! Somebody must have gone barmy . 100 bloomin ' extra kids first day of term ! Your turn to do the shoes . The staff sleeping problem presents some difficulties . Whose room is this ? Hyde-Brown 's and mine . Pleasant little room . Now , let 's see , ... do you think we might put two more beds in here , hmm ? Any difficulties ? None , except how to get into bed . You 're not adopting a very helpful attitude , Billings . We 're obliged to offer the school our hospitality . I suggest we do it with grace . It 's not too much to ask you to share your rooms with the staff . We wo n't find suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to give you a lead , ... Billings , I must say that I should be only too glad to share my room with my opposite number in St Swithin 's . As I expected - an ancient mausoleum . Topping grounds for the Guides and Brownies to muster in . The mustering of the Guides and Brownies is not our only activity , miss Gossage . No . If there are any dorms facings south , Miss Jezzard , see that our girls get them . The infant animal needs space to breathe and blow . We could settle the whole thing quickly by sleeping the kids two in a bed . End to end . We 've the parents to consider . We must appear to give them value for their money . No , I 'm afraid we must seek other fields for St Swithin 's . That 's a thought . Mmm ? Fields , sir . I 'm quite sure , Hyde-Brown , your ready wit must make you exceedingly popular in the fourth form . Heavenly place . I never heard of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliging someone , ... but he 's not obliging US . We 're not slaves . Nobody said you were . BELL RINGS The front door bell 's ringing , Milly . Oh , let it ring . I shall speak to Mr Hyde-Brown about this . Evidently not on their toes . We 'll try our luck inside . Well , a tap on that gong should bring them from their burrows . Yes , miss Whitchurch . LOUD BONGS A tap , Gossage . I said a tap . You 're not introducing a film . We 're not getting on very fast , gentlemen . There are still 60 boys to accommodate . GONG SOUNDS Matthews , find out who 's ringing that gong . If it 's one of the boys , give him 100 lines . There must be somewhere else . Uh ... The attic . We ca n't bumble around here all day . ... What 's in there ? It 's another sort of hall , miss Whitchurch . I seem to detect an odour of last term 's cottage pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this up , there ought to be room here for about , ooh , 60 boys . What about air , sir ? Air ? ! Oof ! Let me see now . Well , if we open this skylight ... Mmm ! Well , I daresay it will open . And keep the hatch wide , there ought to be a nice through draught . I 'm wondering more and more what 's in store for us , Gossage . It 's a perfectly ghoulish atmosphere . The sunlight seems quite out of place . No polish on the stairs or banisters , and dust everywhere ! Whatever else they teach here , it certainly is n't housecraft . Are you in the habit of writing your name all over the place , Gossage ? No , Miss Whitchurch . Then kindly stop doing it at once . SHE KNOCKS Well , the mistresses ' common room , I assume . Huh . Cold comfort farm by all appearances ! And billiards ! How very strange . No tips . Huntin ' , shootin ' and fishin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no mention of who caught it . Probably bought at auction . Boxing ! Self-defence , I suppose . Well , does n't surprise me after reading the school motto . No . Heavy smokers , too . No signs of lipstick . That 's astonishing . Cards ? ! The Racehorse ? ! Gaming , nicotine , fisticuffs - ... we 're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity ! Ah ! A woman 's bookshelf is an infallible guide to her character . Oxford English Dictionary , Dictionary Of Phrase And Fable , The Diary Of Samuel Pepys - abridged . Well , that 's something to be thankful for ( ! ) What 's up here ? A-hem . Memoirs Of Casanova . Was n't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet ? Yes . Yes . Decameron Nights . Well , really ! Whatever else this establishment may or may not be , ... it 's clearly not a suitable place to bring carefully nurtured girls to . I should jolly well say not . But what can we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got us into it . They must get us out of it . Well , that settles the sleeping question . Now , it 's the meals . Cook will simply have to stagger them . That should n't be difficult . Come along . Rainbow can bring down the table from the carpenter 's shop . What 's this ? " Gossage " ? Mmm ? Some of the boys starting to arrive ? Give the boy who wrote his name there 50 lines . " Gossage " ? I do n't know any Gossages . Maybe it 's a St Swithin 's kid . Then give him 50 lines . I 'll not have their boys writing their names all over our dust ... Who 's that ? Er , little girl . Yes ? Who ... Who are you ? I mean , what do you want ? This is Nutbourne College . That 's right . I just biked on ahead with Miss Harper 's things . She 's with the crocodile . Crocodile ? ! What on earth 's she talking about ? Who ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's English and history and jolly dee ! In fact , she 's the only decent mistress in St Swithin 's . St Swithin 's ? ! You do n't mean to say that yours is a school of boys AND girls ? Oh , no ! Only girls . Does this mean , sir , that we are to expect 100 young ladies ? It means not only have the Ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all , ... but they 've apparently been guilty of an appalling sexual aberration . I shall ask for the home number of the man responsible . If they refuse , I shall speak to the Minister himself . Do you know what this means , old boy ? Popsies , scores of them . There are only two types of school mistress , chum - the battleaxe and the Amazon . I bet you five bob they fall into one class or the other . The condition of the place is indescribable . Dust and dirt everywhere . And the staff seem to match their surroundings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place to bring well-brought-up girls to ... I agree with that last statement . Will you kindly remove yourself from my chair , my telephone ... Sorry , I did n't catch what you said ... Will you kindly move yourself from my telephone ? ! Will you please refrain from interfering ? I do n't know who you are , but I 'm in the middle of a conversation with the Ministry . Ministry ? ! Hello ? Give me that ! Will you desist at once , sir ? ! You leave me no alternative . How dare you , sir ? How dare YOU , madam ? ! Hello , hello . This is Wetherby Pond speaking , ... the headmaster of Nutbourne College . I do n't know how much you know about what 's going on here , ... but I will not have a girls ' school on my premises , ... not for a single day , not for a single hour , not ... I do n't want your sympathy , man . I want action . I want these women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down this telephone until I know what you 're going to do about it . Have I made myself clear ? Oh , yeah , I understand . But I think you 'd better have a word with the guv'nor when he comes back . Where is he ? Eh ? I think he 's stoking the boilers . To whom am I talking ? Thank you . You were speaking to the junior assistant caretaker . The Ministry is closed ! I take it you are some sort of official in this girls ' school . I do n't like your tone , my man . I 'll answer you when you 're in possession of yourself . Madam , I 'm well able to control myself . Unaccustomed as I am to having girls ' schools thrust upon me , ... no doubt , in years to come , I shall look upon this as amusing . But I sha n't . The only solution is to send your girls back home until the whole position is rectified . Out of the question . At least 50 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come from ! It is impossible for them to remain here . It is equally impossible for them to go elsewhere . At any moment now , they 'll be arriving , ... hot and tired from their journey , bursting for a hot bath and peckish for their high tea . By the way , a-hem , ... my name is Whitchurch . I am Principal of St Swithin 's . Oh ... How do you ... ? How do you do ? What 's more , I make it a rule that junior school go up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire at 6.30 sharp with their milk and biscuits - digestive . Have you digestive ? I do n't know . But if there are any , they 'll be eaten by my boys . Oh , come now , it 's no use playing dog in the manger . Let us face this squarely . Which day do your boys arrive ? Today at 6.15 , hot , tired and peckish for their high tea . Yes , I see your problem . I 'm grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam , I 'm not donning anything . Oh ! We 've just been hurled out of our common room ... By a bunch of ruffians . One pulled me out of my chair . Miss Whitchurch , you realise where we are ? You do n't imagine I 've been here indulging in social chit-chat . Mr Pond , permit me to introduce my staff . No , no , no , no , no . I do n't want to appear rude , but there 's no point in meeting them since they 're not going to remain here . But , madam , I am surprised that you should ignore the domestic absurdity of bringing 100 girls here . There are feeding problems , servant problems ... There 's no problem there , sir . They 're leaving . Left , right . Left , right . Left ... Oh , good egg ! Here 's comes our croc ! And there goes OURS . Three years it 's taken me to get a good kitchen staff . What am I to do ? That 's childishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . Forget ( ! ) It will provide an absolutely superb opportunity for my advanced cookery girls to show their paces . No , madam , not that . Not that ! That 's more than flesh and blood can stand . I 'll go through purgatory with you , but hell - no ! Hell , no ! I owe you a dollar . Thanks . We 're in for a whale of a time . Morris dancing in the gym , eurhythmics on the lawn ... Queues for the bathroom , no smoking anywhere , ... and compulsory cocoa at 11 . I 'm for a couple of voluntary pints at the Coach and Horses before the little beasts arrive . Any takers ? I 'll gladly stand anyone a pint if they 'll care to join me .

Our girls are in the hall , their boys have n't arrived . Come in , Miss Harper . Did you pass a long , bald-headed person ? You mean Pond ? He 's in the common room . Excellent . We 'll find out where their dormitories are and take our girls there . Ladies , you 're facing your supreme test . Remember our netball cry . Effort , St Swithin 's , effort ! Quite so , Miss Gossage . If trespassers threaten your property , you build fences . Hmm ? I propose we lock the dormitories . Hear , hear ! But we must act before that female spawns her young all over the building . Billings , take the fourth-form dormitory , and Hyde-Brown , the fifth . And Matthews and Joue , the third and the sixth . Have you got a key to the common room , sir ? We do n't have to lock this room , Billings ? No , and we ca n't UNLOCK it unless you 've got a key . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside .

It 's rough and ready , Jezzard , but it 'll serve . Yes . Thank you . There we are . Now we 'd better see how they 're faring in the kitchen . Breakfast is at eight sharp , so do n't loiter .

Then put in 233 teaspoonsful and one ... well , perhaps two for the pot . One ... two ... I understand your fishcakes are ready , Alice . For the past 20 minutes . I do n't want any temperament , my dear . What did you put in them ? Or should n't I ask ? Anyway , they smell delicious . They 've gone hard . Never mind .

It 's still Arkwright , but he 's trying to put me on to a Mr Tripp . Apparently Mr Bullock got the papers from Mr Forrester . He passed them on to Mr Arkwright who passed them on to Mr Tripp .

I was just showing them the petunias . Jolly good display this year . A bit past their best , of course . Will you leave us this minute ? I was only giving them a few hints , facts of nature , nothing else . You girls get back to your indoor botany at once . I know it 's slightly distracting to have to work in the hall , but we must try and profit through adversity . We 'll choose a phrase at random , and let us see if we can analyse it . Morning , boys . Morning , miss Whitchurch . We 'll take a phrase ... Please , Mr Pond , ... ask your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I think it advisable to alter the curriculum to cut out the biology classes .

I might as well try to teach in Waterloo station . There 's a lady at the door , sir , wanting to know if you 'll vote for miss Winston in the election . Mrs Hampstead , tell your lady that if there is a male candidate , whether he 's Conservative , socialist , communist or anarchist , ... or , for that matter , Liberal , ... he will have my vote . - That 's what I thought , sir .

Blast , somebody ! BLAST , ANYBODY ! As a young man , I studied yogi for a brief period . It has enabled me to bear with fortitude this situation which otherwise I could never have endured . Poppycock ! Please let me finish . But yogi or no yogi , ... I am determined not to allow the situation to deteriorate further , ... if that were possible . Good afternoon , Mr Tripp . Mr Tripp , since you have apparently done nothing to rectify this state of affairs here , ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrester . I 'm not in the least concerned about an appointment . If Mr Forrester will not see me , I 'll speak to my MP . He 's probably playing golf . Matthews , will you ask Rainbow to get me a taxi , please ? Can I have a word , Miss Whitchurch ? What is it , Miss Jezzard ? This porter . He refuses to take orders from me . I just want to know where I stand . Every time I ask him to do anything , he says he 's too busy . She says I 'm to take the brake to the station , and Mr Hyde-Brown says I 'm to mark out the 2nd XV pitch . Now which is it to be ? Will you tell him or shall I ? Very well , sir , it 's all I want to know . Just a moment , Rainbow . I shall consider these requests entirely on their merits . That 's right , haver about . Why has the brake to go to the station ? To meet parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ours ? Ridiculous . You invited them yourself . Mr and Mrs Parry , Mrs Jones , and Mr and Mrs Ibbertson . They were nervous about what sort of school this was , so you said they could come down and see for themselves . Why did n't you remind me ? We must stop it at once . Stopping the 3 o'clock will be too much even for you . It 's out of the question having the parents here with this man and his rabble around . It had occurred to me ... Nothing ever occurs to you or they would n't be coming . When they see we 're sharing a boys ' school , they 'll withdraw their children . Before we know where we are , we shall have no school left . That will solve the problem . This is no time for prep school repartee . Thinking caps . Thinking caps . I have it ! You must remove your boys for the afternoon . Remove my boys ? From my own school ? ! Mr Pond , for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair measure of harmony ... Harmony ? ! With your shrieking progeny everywhere ! I 'm completely unmoved by your plight , madam . I do n't give a fig . Mr Matthews , Miss Jezzard , would you be good enough to wait outside ? And take the porter with you . There is talk in the common room that you are seeking an appointment as headmaster of Harlingham . What has that got to do with removing my boys ? I thought you might like to know that I 'm acquainted with one of the governors of that school . Oh , madam , I should not consider a recommendation from you an advantage . I was n't thinking of a recommendation . You were trying to coerce me with threats , madam ? The law takes a serious view of that . Have you the temerity to suggest that I 'm trying to blackmail you ? ! I shall merely make a factual report . I see . There appear to be no depths to which you are not prepared to sink . If you have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jezzard and Mr Matthews and lay our plans ? Run ! Run ! What on earth 's going on with the goalposts ? The school 's got to beat it to the swimming baths . What ? Some of the girls ' parents are visiting . There 's to be no sign that the shadow of man has crossed here . How long 's this to last ? Matinee performance only . Oh , look , there they are . Group dancing . Yeah . Two guineas extra . We know . Mrs Ibbertson is wearing that white hat she wore in the summer . This is no time for tittle-tattle . How do you do , Mrs Ibbertson ? So nice to see you . Miss Jezzard . ... How do you do , Mrs Jones ? A delightful spot . Yes . ... How do you do , Mr Parry ? How do you do ? Tea will be laid in the study . A gracious old hall , do n't you think ? Yes . Still it must be trying to share a school . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . Is there any difference in class with the other school ? Not so much of class as of outlook . I think I 'll show you the dining hall first . I hope you do n't let the girls mix too much . Not if I can help it . This dining hall is a gem in its way . Of course , it 's rather a squeeze when they 're all here . But we stagger most of the meals . " Guard thine honour " ? The Nutbourne school motto . In my young day , such things were taken for granted . Well , the place goes back to Henry VIII . They tell me this part of the building used to be a barn before they rebuilt it . Well ... what about pottering upstairs ? I 'm sure a cup of tea would be welcome . It would indeed . And then to the fray like giants refreshed . Off we go . I understand Henry built it for Anne Boleyn , ... but she was beheaded before she could move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? Shall we see the other school ? They 've gone on an all-day ramble . I wish you could have seen us working in tandem . No , that 's the common room . What a snug retreat ! Yes , it is rather nice . A bit on the small side for our two staffs , but it serves . Looks out onto the grounds . May I ? Of course . Oh ! There 's nothing much to see , I 'm afraid . Quite an attractive view . Yes , is n't it ? They tell me you can see the sea on a clear day .

But he could n't have known when . He 'll never be headmaster of Harlingham now . You do n't need a crystal to tell you that . He will remain here then . For life . You realise what that means ?

Which ... way are you going , Billings ? Through Fairhurst and Upper Dudley and Lower Dudley and Braxton . The short way . That 's right , Billings , the short way . I ask no more for youth than space and air and freedom from distraction . I 'm glad to hear that , Miss Whitchurch . Cynthia has reached the difficult age . Angela 's just the same . I 'm sure Miss Whitchurch grasps the dangers of adolescence . Firmly , in both hands , if I may say so . TELEPHONE RINGS Shall I answer it ?

What shape 's yours in ? It varies . Very pleasant outlook here . Uninterrupted too , the estate agents say . Mr Tassell , I 'm all for team spirit and I do n't want to rock the boat , but I ca n't keep my girls cooped up here all afternoon . Well , just hold on a minute . Ah , Matthews . This is Mr Matthews , my most able second-in-command . Mr Angus McNally , Dr Collet ... How do you do , sir ? ... and Reverend James Rich . Well , gentlemen , shall we go inside ? Here we are .

After you , gentlemen . What happened ? I 'm sorry , sir . We did what we could in the time . We got the girls out the playing field . Where are the rest of them ? Still here , I 'm afraid . Miss Whitchurch is having tea with the parents in her study . HER study ? YOUR study , sir . She wo n't be for long . There 's simply no holding Byron at lacrosse this term , so Tennyson and Shelley are going to stop the rot . When you 've finished your tea , we 'll see how the battle is faring . The sun 's very gay this afternoon . Another cup of tea , Mr Ibbertson ? Miss Whitchurch , I must speak to you at once . Oh , Doctor , if it 's about that little protuberance on Cecilia Watson 's neck , I 'll see you in the common room . If you do n't mind , Doctor . Excuse me , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How dare you burst in there , jeopardising my position in that reckless fashion ? I do n't care what you have to say . Do I have to remind you about the governors of Harlingham ? No . They are in the dining hall , here to see the school . They 've shut Shelley , Tennyson and Byron in the pav . Shut your other brats with them , I 'm bringing my boys back from the swimming pool at once . Quiet . My parents will hear you . Your parents can go and ... Mr Pond ! I do n't want the whole building involved in the brouhaha . We 'll thrash this out in the common room . 1931 was a vintage year , as you see . Three scholarships to Oxford , two to Cambridge . Before Pond , I imagine . It 's no use brandishing governors . One look at what 's going on , and my chances of Harlingham are ruined . I 'll have to establish myself as a victim of circumstances . Ramsden , tell Mr Matthews to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . So that 's where they are . My mind is made up on one thing , Miss Whitchurch . If I sink , you sink with me . Do n't act as if next week will do , man ! Wait ! Why should we sink , Mr Pond ? If we keep our wits , we can still come through with flying colours . Let us examine this problem calmly . Miss Whitchurch , the governors are in the dining hall . And my parents are in the study . Both parties wish to tour the school . Very well , so they shall . But never the twain shall meet . What will happen when the governors meet a swarm on girls ? They must n't . The governors must only see boys , the parents girls . We 'll have two conducted tours going clockwise or anticlockwise , as the case may be . It 's no use being lily-livered . If one party leaves five minutes after the other , ... we 'll have time to interchange classes . It 'll have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same course . If you want my opinion , the whole thing 's imposs . We do n't want your opinion . Thank you , Miss Gossage . Every single boy and girl would have to co-operate . Yes . That would mean Doris , Cynthia and Pamela deceiving their parents . A half holiday will cure that . Where 's your child psychology ? That 's not the school spirit . Do n't talk to mr . Pond like that , Gossage . Thank you , miss Whitchurch . Kindly leave these arrangements to us . What exactly do you envisage , miss Whitchurch ? Well , if I take my parents to see the school museum , ... while you bring your governors to tea in the study , ... that will give us time to set the stage . Yes . Now , let us swiftly plot the itinerary . Please , allow me . Thank you , Mr Pond . Now , this must be very exactly timed . Shall we first synchronise our watches ? Excellent . I 'm not a complaining man , Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual job that I do n't look forward to , ... but today we 've had ' em up , taken ' em down and had ' em up again !

Do n't argue , get the boys back to school . BLOWS WHISTLE We 'll just have a quick cup , then start on our travels . Priscilla Johnson was romping in a haystack when that Bastard Purple alighted on her . She had him in the killing bottle in a flash . Here they come , girls . Onto the field again . Buck up !

I 'd like to see what they know . Certainly . Metcalf , would you give us an example of a mixed metaphor ? Playing with fire . Skating on thin ice .

I brought you right into this room , did n't I ? - Right here . - Yes and I said , " it 's all right , John , I was saving them for you anyway . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden you were n't sick anymore . You 've got to begin to accept the fact that I 'm no longer a baby . You 've got to get used to the idea . You were the gurglingest baby . Well , there you go again . Ah , I used to put you on my knee and bounce you up and down . Up and down . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings on . One shoe off and one shoe on , teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John . And you said , " do it again , mommy , do it again , mommy . " Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed ... I got tired on this knee , and I put you on this knee . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings ... you used to wear me out . Do it again , mother . You 're joking . No , I 'm not . Yes , you are . Oh , I can ... Well , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your father . - Oh , mother . - Oh , no . I do n't understand . No , John . Not with me . It 's me . You remember me ? Oh ... When it gets to the stage where you 're making fun of a mother 's love ... oh , no , mother . II ... I guess I 'm just like all the other mothers . I ca n't take it . Making fun of my lullaby . Spoiling my memories . Oh , but I did n't mean it , mother . Oh , yes , you did . With all my heart , I did n't . Well , then do n't ... do n't act " like the cur in the story . " ? Do n't bite the hand that 's feeding you ? You 're laughing . I made you ... well , you can still do that , ca n't you ? Well , if it takes my tears to make you laugh , that 's all right , I do n't care . Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fender . That 's right . Did you come to laugh about it ? Well , no , I , uh , the , uh ... I was playing cowboy and Indians with the neighbor 's child and trying to do my work at the same time . What do you want ? Oh , oh , well , it 's about that , um , the ... the bent Fender , you know ? It came to a little more than I expected . It , uh , was , um , $18 ... do n't choke over it . No , I 'm not ... and 70 odd cents . I see , that 's why you 're here . Well , you know , after all , $18 is $18 . Oh , I know , I know , with taxes the way they are . Well , yes , you have to , uh , make a lot more than ... Well . Your attitude 's a little different from what it was yesterday . Well , yesterday , I did n't ... well , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I , uh ... Would pick a time when my husband was n't here . What makes you presume that it was our fault ? Well , I think that 's a rather natural presumption . Oh , yes , Sunday Christian , huh ? Well , I ... I mean , I 'm just drivin ' along minding my business when , boom , it 's a crash and I look back and then at you . Whose fault do you think that was ? Why did n't you look where you were going ? Look ? You hit me from behind . After all , I have n't got eyes in my rear . No ? Well , I ... I mean , I , you know , I ca n't ... I ca n't see what 's in back of me . I thought that 's what you meant . You meet some peculiar people nowadays . A lot of pettiness in the world , do n't you think so ? Lady , there 's nothing petty about $18 . It was the 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't think we hit anybody else yesterday . Hope you did n't have any trouble at the front door . Well , no , that , um , that was a present from my two sons . They 're in the service . Yes , they were here last week . We had a sort of , um , farewell dinner . Well , I ... oh , but pardon me , you want to fight the battle of 18.70 , what is it ? It does seem a little silly to squabble about a repair bill when boys like yours are ... oh , you 've got another side . Yeah . Maybe you 'd like to squabble over a cup of coffee . Yeah , I 'd like that . Come in . Bring the bill . I got it . That 's what my boys sent me . Well , that 's ... that 's beautiful . I 'm just dying to try it on . Why do n't you ? I think I will . That 's nice . Mmhmm . Madame butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as sad as poor butterfly . It 's , uh , it 's only that this was sent from San Francisco . That 's a harbor , is n't it ? That 's where ships sail from ? Yeah . Well , that was a welcome interruption . Yes ? Cleaner . Yes , it is . Where 's Mrs . Jefferson ? Oh , she 's , uh , on the phone . I 'll take it . Yes ? No , he is n't here now . Who is calling , please ? Uh-huh . Would n't you think people would leave their names ? These are my two boys . The one's that , uh ... yeah . Look like a great pair of halfbacks . Yes . This one used to pass to that one . Yes , he 'd fade way back . Oh , yeah , to give him a chance to get down the field . Uhhuh . And then ... Boom , touchdown . You have two fine boys , all right . Oh , we have another son , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has more degrees than a thermometer . I said there was only one bright one in the family . He 's brilliant though , really . He 's going to give the commencement address at his university . Oh , that John Jefferson . Well , he is ... he 's just famous , that 's all . He does n't know it , but his father and I are going to be there to hear him . Oh , that 's wonderful . Well , I may be there myself . That 's my Alma mater , too . - Oh ? - Mm-hmm . Well , uh , does ... he does n't live here with you now then . No , he 's just visiting . He 's in Washington . That phone call , that was for him . Oh . That was long distance from Washington . He has a great career ahead of him . Well , it seems you have three fine sons , Mrs . Jefferson . Mmhmm . God was good to me . Oh , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You 're a wonderful mother . Is your mother still living ? I have a wonderful mother , too . Nothing petty about her . Oh , you should n't have done that . You never would have got it anyway . Mother ? Yes , John ? Hi . Oh , you said you 'd be home early . Have a good day ? Mm , fine . Well , my day was ... little lonely ? Oh , I 'm sorry , mother . I promise that I 'll see more of you . You do , John . You had a long distance phone call from Washington , D.C . Oh . Uh , who was it ? They did n't leave any name . What did he , um , did he leave any message ? It was a girl , John . You 've got a girl , John ? Oh , no , mother , it was probably just a routine call from the office . No , it was a payphone . I heard her drop a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call back later . Mmhmm . Where 's father ? He 's , uh , going over your notes . Oh . Well , I hope I was of some help on his speech . Well , uh , he did n't say ... John ? Father . How 's your supper coming ? Oh , fine . Well , I 'm sorry that I missed you this morning , father . Well , it was as much my fault as yours , son . I ate in haste , I had to leave . Well , uh , did you find my notes useful ? That 's what I wanted to talk to you about , John . I hope you got my points , father , because I did n't want you to be saying things that you did n't mean . Now , you know , I realize as well as you that the legion is a great force for good and caution must be shown to avoid the danger of a misuse of their power . Well , do n't you think fighting men can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , father . Well , then what happened to my first line ? We legionnaires must fight to keep the power in the people and if we let the state give us freedom , it also has the power to take it away . You , uh , you did n't find any substitute for that , you just , uh , marked that out with a blue pencil . Put your line back . Darn right I will . Put the wholespeech back , it 's all right with me . That 's what_i intend to do . I said , " when the state denies God given rights and regards itself as a source of liberty , freedom is doomed . " That is n't even your idea , is it ? No , I copied it . What difference does that make ? Copying it does n't make it right . I copied it right . Just wait there . John . Oh , father , let 's not go into it anymore . No , I 've ... I 've got another subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a talk . A good talk , away from your mother , and it 's about you , son . Well , if you 'd enjoy it , father . Well , I do n't know whether you will . As I told you , we 're alert and we are alert . You just said that . Yes . And you sound to me like one of those guys that we should be alert about . One of those guys , father ? I just said that you sounded like one , I did n't say that you ... ' cause if I thought that you really were , you know , I 'd take you out in the backyard and I 'd give it to ya both barrels . No trial , huh ? Nah , you 're off on the wrong slant . And you know what I 'm talking about ' cause as your father , I wan na know where you 're at it . Well , I can help you there . I 'm headed for the bathroom . Wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go with you . Yes ? Yes , it is . Yes , he 's here now . Just a moment . Thanks , mom . Hello ? Yes . Uh , lu , I 'm sorry , but I 'm going on down to the legion now . Well , what about supper ? I 'll eat something when I get home . Oh , but you must have a bite . Well , I 'm not hungry . Oh , I 'll hurry it up . Now , look , the meeting is n't till 8:00 . You have two whole hours . Well , it 'll take me two hours to get my speech back the way it was . All right , see you later , son . Good luck , Dan . Thanks , I can use it . I can hear ya now . Yes . Yes . I heard you . I heard ... yes , goodbye . Oh , I ... I ... I know how you feel , mother . Do you ? I do n't understand father 's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . With a son like me ? You look worried , John . What , was it that phone call that did it ? Well , it was important , yes , mother , but , well , do n't , uh , let 's not go into how I look again . All right . I ... I made ... I made a cocktail in case anybody was in the mood . Good , let 's keep it bright . I made enough for three , but ... you know , I ... I do n't like to get back to father again , mother , but ... if you did n't , I would . He 's so troubled , John . You know , when we left you off at the university ... Yes ? Well , um , he was so mad that you 'd rather talk to highbrow professors that he smashed right into another car . Oh , he did ? Was it father 's fault ? Well , he claimed that the other fella stopped too fast . Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man came by here today with his bill , but I talked him out of it . He finally tore it up . Oh , he finally tore it up . Well , um , did you ... did you have to do a lot of talking ? Oh , I certainly did . He was downright ornery at first . Well , I turned him into a nice fella . You know , warmed him up with some coffee . Well , you two had quite a chat . Yes , we had quite a chat . I told him about Ben and Chuck , what great athl ... about this fellow , uh , did he ... I was talking about your brothers . You keep wanting to talk about this fella . What 's the matter , John ? Does it bother you that I talk too much to strangers ? Oh , no ! It 's just that , well , it does seem odd that the fellow would come all of this way merely to tear up his bill . Yes . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . Maybe . Now I 'm bothered . I told him about you . He seemed very interested . You know me , John , when I get started about you . Oh , yes , mother . Did you , uh , did you start when I was a boy with a penny jar ? No . I did ... Quite a lot of talking though . Here it is , John . - Hm ? - Remember ? Yes . Oh , my pills , I forgot . What are they for , mother ? Modern science has pills for women of my age , John . For , uh , people who forget where they put ' em . They 're supposed to insure us against going goofy . Goof insurance . Oh . I told Dr . carver that I 'd just as soon put my faith in God and what he intended . I 'd go along with science , too , mother , and take those little tablets . What about Moses and the tablets he left us ? With the prescription written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need any pills . No . I always got my strength from two books , both very nourishing in their own way . The cookbook and the Bible . Remember how I used to trick you into learning this one with this one . I 'd say to you , " I 'll make you , um , cookies , pies , cakes , and jam , if you 'll learn Matthew , mark , Luke , and John . " We had a kind of a deal , remember ? Mmhmm . John , what is the matter with you ? Oh , mother , I 've got more important things on my mind than cakes and cookies . And Luke and John . I , um , I 've got to make a phone call , mother . Lehigh 2-4-1-1 , please . I 'm sorry , mother . Um , what time is your next plane for New York ? Not until 12 ? Yeah , I know , but I 've got to get there right away . I mean , I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . I 'm sorry to be popping in on you at this hour , but you heard my announcement about the clothing drive . Oh , my bundle is n't ready yet , father . Oh , I have a lot of things for you , especially now since Ben and Chuck are gone , but I have to go clear up in the attic to get them . Will tomorrow be all right ? Well , I suppose it 'll have to be . I 've been thinking about that joke that was told me Sunday . You know , the one about everybody helping me in this world and then trying to find me in the next . The joke has questionable merit and if John thinks what I ... he 's on the phone . Oh , hello , John ! Hi , father . I 'm doing a little work for the poor . John ? What ? I 'm trying to help out a few people in this world , too . - Goodnight , father . - Goodnight . Well , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the car and ... well , then how much further is that from your field ? Damn . All right , yes . Bye . Come in . Mother ? All packed ? Yes . I wish I could leave with you feeling better . You could . I 'm all right . I listened , John , when your father was saying some awful things to you . Oh , well , that 's terrible , mother . No wonder you were so upset . I still am . Well , do n't let father poison your thinking . I 'm sure that I can clear this up in your mind . Do , John . Father is muddled , mother . He thinks in the past . The world at this point is in a turmoil and muddled thinking like father 's certainly is n't going to help . Young thinkers are dreaming of the future , mother , what 's ahead of us . Why not ? Go ahead . Our only hope is to learn to live with our fellow man . The globe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . We must tear down our spite fences and learn to live with our neighbors . That 's good , John . Tear down our spite fences , love thy neighbor . Go on , I go along with you so far . Good . Now father thinks ... what do you think ? I love humanity , mother . I love the downtrodden , the helpless minorities . Good , John . That 's what I tried to teach you . You know by heart that we must labor to help the weak , like Saint Paul said . No one can tell me that an early religious training does n't show itself . Good . I know everything that you stand for , mother , and what I 'm striving for is an intelligent and practical way to bring into existence a new and better ordered world . Wewe did understand each other , did n't we ? Yes . Remember how I pleaded for your education ? How they teased me that you were my favorite . You 're part of me and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a part of you . I had dreams myself , John , of great things to be done . But a wife and mother does n't have much time for more than put off till tomorrow . I ... I hoped , John , that ... You 'd see that someday my tomorrows would come through , some of them . We talk the same language and we think the same way . Of course we do . But , now , try to understand me . Everything that we agree on , you and I , I warn you , this is liberal thinking . So what ? If we think this way , we 're leftists , communists , subversive . That 's ridiculous . Well , of course it is , but that 's the way father thinks . Oh , he does n't mean that . Aw , I know , mother . Father 's wonderful . And I 'd do anything to convince him that he 's so wrong about me . Well , just tell him what you told me , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his head . I ... I want to prove once and for all how ridiculous his suspicions are . I 'd go to any lengths , mother , for your sake . I would swear on a stack of bibles . You would ? Well , it 's just an expression . But so expressive . That 'll do it . Oh , I 'm beginning to feel better already . You know how religious your father is , wait till we tell him . Go ahead . Oh , mother . Go ahead . How does it go ? Oh , mother . I swear that I am not now or ever have been a member of the communist party . Feel better ? I ca n't wait for your father to come home . I 'm a little relieved myself . You ca n't blame me now . Well , you really were worried , mother . Well , it alarmed me , you know ? You kept talking about this fellow with a silly bill . I thought it had something to do with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? I do n't know . I mean , I did n't ... you mean my telephone conversation , my having to leave suddenly has got something to do with this man in the ... yes , yes , yes . Oh , mother , I 'm ashamed of you . I 'm ashamed . Well , you see , that just shows you what one remark like father 's can do . Oh , I 'd hate to tell you what I was thinking . Your brain was racing , huh ? Was it . Well , now , you ... you get out of here . I 'm going to get dressed and I 'm going to get you something to eat . Oh , mother , no , I 'm not hungry . Anyway , I should be calling my cab , you know ? Oh . Well , meeting broke up early ? No , no , I left early . What are you up to ? Well , I was just calling a cab , father . I have to leave suddenly . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , was it ? Did what I had to say in there cause you to ... oh , no , no , father . How was your speech ? Eh , you know that crowd . They , uh , they 're not too bright . They applauded me . Where 's your mother ? She 'll be down in a minute . Will you and I have time to finish our talk ? It 'll have to be brief , father , because my cab is on the way . Well , it can be . And if you wo n't remember where you were , I know where I was . It 's your turn to talk , so think over what you 're gon na say and I 'll see how your mother is . Well , John , I ... Hm . Mm-hmm . Hm . This , uh , this is the Bible that your mother taught ... forgive me , son , if I look a little fuddled ... well , that 's all right , father . Your mother just told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . She told me that she 'd heard us . Or heard you , father . Well , anyway , she believes in you . You 've made her very happy , son , and I 'm glad because I 've tried to make things pleasant for her . Dr . carver , he told me ... father , try a little harder , will you ? Because you brought this on by leaping to the accusation ... no , I never accused you . Oh , yes , you did , father . No , I just said that you ... that you talk like a scummy . Uhhuh and mother heard it , so now she 's upset . Well , anyway , I hope that this settles the whole thing . I mean , I ca n't do any more than swear on mother 's Bible , so I hope that we can now forget everything that 's happened , huh ? I hope so , yes . But , if you were , uh ... yes , father , go ahead . What ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a thing , would it , huh ? A whole stack of bibles . Well , there you go again . I know , I know . Father , open your mind and let this in , will you ? The church , they 'd believe me . The courts , they 'd believe me . Mother believes me , but you do n't . Mmmm , not yet . Do you believe in the Bible ? Well , now , father , do you believe every page ? I mean Jonah and the whale ... I believe every page , son . Jonah and the whale ... even the pages you do n't understand . I believe in those , too . That 's faith . That certainly is , father . You mean you believe in heaven and hell 's fire ... I sure as there 's a hell do . Listen , son , take the first commandment . Do you believe in the lord thy God ? What about honoring your father and mother ? That 's the fourth commandment . Well , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that one . Oh , father . What page was that on ? I do n't know what page it 's on . You made me do it . What have you done , Dan , what have you done ? You hit your son ! Well , he was just trying to pound some religion into me , mother . He tripped over the table . Will you get out of here ? Dan , will you get ... come on , come on , come on . Oh , please ... get on down to the legion . Now do n't get yourself , lu , all excited . Put it on . Yes , mother , I 'll put the coat on , but I wish you would n't get yourself ... and your hat , now , go on . Put the hat on . Maybe they 've got some more beer left . There is . A whole barrel of it . So you 're against me , too . Guess I 'm just too dumb to get it . No , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . Hitting your own son . No , I did n't hit him , I just merely pushed him ... get out of here . ' Cause he 's clumsy . Well , I 'll have to go and change , mother ... I know you will ... I know ... wait a minute . Just let me ... let me sterilize it for you . Oh , mother , you do n't have to . Put a band-aid on it or something . Oh , that 's an ugly thing . Well , I told you that this would happen . I know you did , I know . I just ca n't talk to him . Well , there 's my cab , mother . Here , I 'll do it . Well , I 've got ta change my pants anyway . And I 've got ta catch the plane before midnight . Call a cab ? Yes , be there in a minute . I 'll get it , mother . Hello ? Ben ! Well , how are you ? Where are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to pay a visit to mother and dad . Chuck , how are ya ? Hiya , boy . You keep up the fight in the home front , wo n't ya , John ? Yes , yeah , I 'll be in there punching . Well , good luck to both of you . And I 'll put somebody on so you can get your money 's worth . Hello , Chuck . You in San Francisco ? I got the kimono , it 's wonderful . I was a little disappointed though , no opium pipe . She got the kimono . Hi , mom . Hello , Ben . Chuck says you may be leaving soon . I hope you 're on a slow boat . Goodbye , boys . Goodbye , mom ! Byebye . They 're leaving , John . I wo n't hear those voices again for a long time . Well , mother , maybe we 'll have a lasting peace one day soon . Oh , you fight for that , John , in your way , and say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light two candles for them , I 'll light one for you , too . Good . Bye . Now , do n't forget you 're my tomorrows , John . What 's the matter , dear ? Goodbye . Oh , your knee . Oh , it 's all right . Soso many things on my mind . What are you gon na do about the trousers ? Oh , they 're ruined . Throw them away . Give them to father o'dowd . Goodbye . And you drive carefully now . - So long ! - Or I 'll school you ! Good morning . Good morning . I 'll fix that . You look like you finished the barrel . People who are n't so bright can hold a lot . Dan , I blew up . I 'm sorry I threw you out of the house . That is a commie specialty . - What ? - Breaking up homes . I may not be bright , but I know that . I 'll have to talk to you in the morning . John stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but he loves humanity , Dan . He may love humanity , but he 's not for his old man . I 'm a human being , I 'm human . No crying , jagna . Ca n't stand anybody that looks into the future . You ca n't even stand . I 'm all right . John explained it all so clearly , Dan . You 're suspicious of anybody that has liberal views . Saint Paul was a liberal ... leave Saint Paul out of this . You leave the lamp alone . Listen . Let 's just stick to John 's kind of liberalism , hm ? They just caught one of his kind down in Washington . But you do n't mean for a minute to infer ... she knows a lot of people that talk just like our son John . That 's the beer talking . No , it is n't . I switched to bourbon . You 're in fine shape to teach little children in the morning . I 'm not teaching little children in the morning . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the use of teaching honesty , goodness , love of home and country ? Hm ? Nobody gives a hang . Oh , some mothers are very interested in report cards . Good grades , not character , high marks . Fathers , they just do n't care . I take that back . One father did come to the school . He wanted me fired . He heard that I had mentioned God in the classroom . His little son of a ... father like that snitched on me . I must teach his little stool pigeon reading , writing , and ' rithmetic . Just suppose that he gets excellent in the three r 's and he gets a goose egg for character . Reading , excellent . But if he reads nothing about his faith , whatever it might be , his head will be as empty as ... as John thinks mine is . Take writing . There 's a lot of good writing on bad checks . Forgers have excellent penmanship . Am I boring you ? Oh , go to bed , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit your son . I 'll tell you now and then I 'll go to bed . I saw red when he said that i made it difficult for him to honor his father and his mother . It 's wrong . He honors his mother . And so do I . I honor you , lu . But he makes fun of ... oh . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . But he makes fun of his father . You saw how he acted when I sang my song . ? If you do n't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back ... ? ? Now who 's breaking up our home ? If I broke anything , I 'll fix it . I just wanted to show you how silly your son behaves . Where does he get his awkwardness ? You know , I 've been thinking . I 'm not going to quit . I 'm going back to school in the morning and keep on teaching little children . Hello ? Yes . Yes . Hello , John . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too bad your father is n't here so you could talk to him . Well , John , I know how busy you are and this is expensive , but believe me it was worth it , dear . And I hope that your day is as bright as you 've made mine . Goodbye . What ? Oh . Your trousers ? Those old things ? Well , I gave them to father o'dowd like you told me to . Why ? Did you leave anything in them ? John , you seem upset . Is that why you called ? All right . All right , I 'll get them . I w ... I will . I 'll get them this evening . Right away . All right . Your father has the car , but I 'll walk over . All right . Well , it was good to get to talk to you , John . Goodbye . What is the reason for this visit , Mr . ? You did n't tell me your name before . Suppose you start right off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jefferson . Federal bureau of investigation . Mm-hmm . No , I wo n't , uh , take your hat . I have a feeling that you 're not going to stay long . Would you mind if I sit down ? I do n't care . I 'm aware this is a shock to you and I ... I do n't want to frighten you . I 'm not at all frightened , Mr . stedman . I seem to ... to startle you . Naturally . When you showed me who you are . No , no , even before that . I ... I thought that you looked , uh , you looked more shocked when you saw me than when you found out who I am . Well , suppose you say why you 're here and I 'll try to have the right expression . It 's about John . What 's he d ... what do you think he 's done ? I 'm not sure that he 's done anything . Well , you wo n't be any more sure by talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you anything anyway . Well , you 're within your rights to refuse . Were you within your rights when you wormed your way ... that 's right , you wormed your way , into my confidence so I 'd do a lot of talking . I know that ... that our methods are very often criticized by certain sources because we 're after them day and night . But nobody objects to a firm that protects its business by investigating your credit . Insurance outfits have to protect themselves by thorough investigations . Well , I ... I 've always had great respect for you people , up to now . Do you ... you care to answer any questions ? Or not ? Like , for instance ? I 'd like to know why John left suddenly . Well , I know why . He had a perfectly good reason for leaving suddenly . But I see no reason why I should tell you . I know this , though , I 'm leaving suddenly . I have a lot of things to do . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things i have to do . You can stay around though , it 's all right . Look the house over . Oh , you 'll find my beds are n't made . I have n't done my housework yet , thanks to you . Oh . There you are , father . Oh , hello , there ! Did you come over to help us ? I want you to see this . Now there 's something that anybody could use . Mrs . mooney gave me that . Oh , the woman has a heart of gold . Father , I want something back . You Indian giver . Well , you know those trousers I gave you ? They 're John 's and he wants them back . Then he 's the Indian giver . Perhaps he left something in them . No , I , uh , I asked him that and he said no . They seem worthless to me . Well , we 'll find them if they 're here . Here 's some of my stuff . Would you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... they were gray . - Gray . - Flannel . Flannel . They had a little stripe in them , I think . Gray flannel with a little stripe in them . There 's gray flannel with a little stripe in them , but , uh , that 's a coat . Is there any other kind of a hint that you could give me or a clue ? Yes , there is . Here they are . Well , they 're not much , are they ? Well , to me , those trousers are a complete ruin . That 's what I tried to tell him . How in the world did he ever do that ? Hehe ... he sort of tripped . He had a nasty fall . Well , I do n't care who his tailor is , he 'll never fix that up so they look like their Sunday best . Well , they 're good material though , you know ? Oh , yes , they are good mat ... oh , he could fix it , he could . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . I 'll tell you what you could do . You could cut them off right there . Make short pants of them . Oh , I noticed Sunday when I talked to John , he 's changed considerable since he wore short pants . But I 've always said he was the best altar boy I 've ever had . He not only served the mass , but he had sort of a , well , a nuance . He looked good doing it , like a notre dame quarterback . And on the other hand , you 'll take Chuck and Ben . When they served the mass ... now look at ya . The minute I mention Chuck and Ben . Goodbye , father . Goodbye . Will you do that ? Excuse me just a moment . Arbie 's ? Just a moment . Telephone . Yeah ? She got in , huh ? It looks like it . Well , she 'll either come to see me or go to that other place . Yeah , well , there 's a nice view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol over here . And , uh , down through here there 's a little park that , um ... Oh , you 're tired , mother . Why do n't you sit down ? Now , tell me , how did you get here ? I flew . No ! How did you get up enough nerve to get on a plane ? Oh , I have n't . You seemed so anxious to have these in a hurry . Oh , but you did n't have to ... well ? Oh , mother , you could 've mailed them . I mean , I merely wanted ... the trousers , yeah . Not particularly glad to see me , just glad to see the trousers , huh ? Oh , mother , the trousers . I 'm tickled to see you . I 'm just ... well , I 'm just surprised that you 'd fly all the way down here . Yeah . Well , things work out for the best , do n't they ? Here I made such a fuss over these trousers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . You know , when you told me that you had to walk all that way it worried me and I called you back to tell you to take a cab on me , but there was n't any answer . Oh , I was gone , I ... But there was somebody there . He ... no , I guess maybe he was gone , too . Who ? That man you 're not worried about . He came back . As long as you 're not worried about him , his name is stedman . He came back . Well , then you brought these trousers down just so you could talk about him , hm ? You know , I 've been thinking about him . He could have been with the FBI , you know , on one of those routine loyalty checks . We should n't resent it . I mean , after all , it 's their duty to investigate and protect us . And they 're having to work overtime these days , you know , I mean , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see what you mean , mother . My gosh . But it 's amazing , you know , what our weavers can ... Um . Mother , what was that man 's name again ? You mean stedman , do n't you ? Ca n't I help you anymore ? Do n't deceive me , John . If there 's anything wrong , if you just tell me , you know , then maybe I could help . What are you looking for ? Is it a key ? Well , I thought maybe that there was a key in my trousers , mother , and I thought maybe that you might have it . It 's the key to my apartment . But , darling , it 's of no importance . John , darling , is it of no importance ? Mother , it 's of no importance whatsoever . I mean , I lose it so many times . You know , I hate to keep asking the landlady for another . Do you have it ? Yes , I do , I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you back . No . It was to take a cab . Mmhmm . But I also wanted to tell you about the key , too . I feel faint . I 'm sick . Oh , mother . I hate to rush you , John , but without you , the committee 's just sitting there . Mother , now I 'm in the middle of a big conference right now , but I 'll break that up and take the rest of the day off , hm ? No , it ca n't be . Thought that was you and then I said to myself , " now what in the world can she be doing in Washington ? " Well , I still say what are you doing in Washington ? Came down to see my son . Please do n't ask a lot of things you know already . May I ask if you 're going back to see him again ? Yes , I am . He 's just going to be busy for the next hour and a half . And I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you have some time on your hands , you certainly picked out a nice spot here . I guess you know that 's Jefferson 's memorial over there . He called this liberty of ours a gift of God . The words are inscribed on the memorial . That 's the Washington monument and , um , the Lincoln memorial . No , you ca n't see that from here . That 's just over there beyond those trees . And then , uh , beyond that across the river is Arlington cemetery . That 's famous for those who gave their lives for us . Well , how are those two fighting halfbacks of yours ? Have you heard from them ? They sailed . Now we have to fight on the home front for those two . They 're fighting for everything these dead held dear and the living should . Whatwhat are you trying to do ? Fire up my patriotism ? II just want you to appreciate that everything I 've done on this case I 've done to preserve the things that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson . Do you think my boy is mixed up in this ? Oh , if you thought for one moment . Oh , he could n't possibly . Did , um , did John ever get any phone calls when he was down at the house ? Yes , he ... you were there . We have this miss carlin down here in the district jail . I think it might be a good idea if you listen to her voice and , you see , you have plenty of time . I have my car up here . I warn you , it was n't a very good connection . I remember that . So I picked her up after she left you . I felt sorry for her . Had to have our little joke . Could n't say she was glad to meet me . Hoped she would never see me again . She wanted to make sure that you were n't going to follow her . She 'll turn here in a minute . Mm-hmm . She watched you go around the corner . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chances of being followed . Smitty picked her up here in his car . Then carlin 's apartment is over here on the left , huh ? That 's right . We , uh , we had two hidden cameras outside Ruth 's apartment up here . Mmhmm . See , one was hung from the fire escape and we picked her up coming in the hall . Yeah . Look at that . Look at her hand shake . I do n't blame her . Mine would , too . She knows now . She had all of her chips on this one son . Got a real problem on her hands now . I picked her up here later in the park , sitting on that bench . The beating she 's taken . I 'm gon na have to ask her questions . She being a truthful woman , every answer is going to incriminate her son . It 's gon na be quite a test . God and country or her son , John . She 's headed for the airport now and home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lu ? Lucille ? Hey , lu . What 's the matter ? What have you been up to ? What 's happened ? I flew to Washington , Dan . To see John . You flew to ... Well , I thought we were going to fly together to see him . You beat me to it . You went to apologize for me , huh ? Maybe you 're just a little air sick , dear . I am a little sick , Dan . I had to see John . I 'm sorry , lu . About everything . I brought this all on by hitting my own son . Hitting him was just like hitting you , was n't it , dear ? How could a man be so dumb ? No , you 're not , Dan . Look , I know , I 'm just not very bright . You never said it truer . You are the brightest and dearest . You 've got more wisdom than all of us because you listen to your heart . You 're not blinded by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest and clean . Now do n't overdo it , lu . See , when you talk like that , you 're the one that 's not thinking so straight . It 's not your fault , Dan . Yes , it is . Lu . Lu , I 've been suffering all day long . I 'm gon na tell John tomorrow how wrong I was . I 'm speaking honestly from my heart . What 's the matter , lu ? Would you call Dr . carver , huh ? What is the matter , dear ? I feel ... I do n't know . I feel I want Dr . carver , Dan . Well , here . Lie down . We 'll cover you up . You know , we 'll get Dr . carver . Oh , oh , well , they have no phone , have they ? No , I know , I know . Lu , the doctor 's over at the rebners ' . Now , I 'll go get him . It should n't take very long . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you avoided your father . I came here to find out about you . Why did you leave the office ? We 'll get around to that . Oh , mother , you had me worried sick . Yes , mm-hmm . Did you tell father about your little trip ? I did n't tell him all about it . If I had , it would kill him . Or he 'd kill you . He ... I 've sent him for the doctor . What would kill him , mother ? I mean , I do n't follow . I do n't understand . If he knew that the FBI is after you , John . Mother , I thought I explained to you all about the FBI . Now , no more fancy lies , John . You 'll spend your tomorrows in a federal prison unless you can explain the key to that carlin girl 's apartment . Well , now , what makes you think that I ... because it fits . It opens the door . You mean you went to her apartment ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother , are you out of your mind ? Not yet . You lied to me so much , John , that I had to know the truth . Do I know it now ? Are you guilty , John ? Mother , I 'm guilty to this extent . Now , wait just a minute . You see , darling , Ruth carlin and I were intimate , quite intimate . And naturally , I hesitated telling you . Only one ... one sin in the constitution and that ... and that 's treason . I do n't know what 's happened to my morals for the moment , but is ... is that all ? Is that all you have done ? That 's all , mother . That 's bad . But it 's good . That 's right . But who would believe it , mother ? Besides you and me . Mr . stedman would believe it . He 'd understand . We could get him on the phone . Well , no , mother , that is n't necessary , dear . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret just between us . But we have to tell Mr . stedman , Johnny , he wo n't let it go any further . Oh , I 'll be so happy to tell him . Mother , have you seen him again ? Yes , he came up to me in the park and he took me to see her . To see ... But I ... I did n't recognize her voice , John . He took you down to the jail ? Well , that 's why we ca n't tell him , mother . I mean , he ... It 's his job to persecute innocent people . No , he 'd believe us , John . Un ... unless you 're lying again . You are lying . Look at you . You are guilty . Mother , darling . " Mother , darling . " Listen to you ! Pleading for love , mercy , all the things you 've scoffed at . Now you 're asking for mother love . Confess to the FBI , John . You 've given up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyway . I 'll reach my own decisions , mother . You have to make one big one right now , John . Mother , if you will stand by me , I know that I can show you the light . After I make my speech to the graduating class ... after you what ? Oh , no , you 're not . Just because my son has been poisoned , I 'll ... I 'll not let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . Are you planning to make them over to your pattern ? Made in your image and likeness ? God , help him . Look , before father gets back , please give me the key . The key ? Yes , the key , the key to your freedom . So you 'll be free to go on making other young people as wretched as you are . Spreading despair . Oh , disguised as hope . Well , now , uh , mother ? How do you plan to stop me ? I 'll tell all I know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have n't lost all faith in you . There are issues in the world today , mother , that transcend a mother and son . Yes , there are things that are far greater than you and me and we have to face them , not as mother and son , but as individuals . The cord is severed . All right . So , as an individual , I believe in human dignity , truth . Wow , you certainly are n't talking as a mother now . But you 're ill , dear . You 're talking insanely . Am I ? Within your state of mind , dear , no one would believe what you 're saying . And I 'd be forced to agree with them . A woman in your time of life , dear , under a doctor 's care , two boys in uniform , a husband , my father , inflaming you with patriotic fanaticism about spies and traitors . John , you could n't . Do ... do you mean that ... You might perhaps have me put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I want to give him the key . Dan , I ca n't fight much longer . Is it in your purse ? No , it is n't . What are you going to do , John ? Use force and violence on your mother ? Someday , mother , you 'll understand how big our fight is . I do now , I do now . No , you do n't . There are millions on my side . Millions on my side . And what a fight you have on your hands . Wait a minute , mother . Do n't say a word about this . Why not ? Dan , Dan . Hello , Mrs . Jefferson . Come in , Mr . stedman . This is my son , John . Well , I 'm sorry , Mr . stedman , you could n't have come at a worse time . My mother is very ill . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that . But my father will be here any minute with the doctor , but we 're terribly worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imagining all sorts of things . No . He came at a good time . He came at a good time . Come in , Mr . stedman . You , too , John . Go ahead . You start it , Mr . stedman . I would like to ask a few questions . Yes , indeed , I am ... and that is if your mother 's condition will permit . Well , obviously , it does n't , I 'd like to ask you a few questions myself first . We gather information , we do n't give it up . Mr . stedman , you know that it 's within our rights to ask you to leave this house immediately . No , John , this is my house . It has a mortgage on it . You know that , John . We always thought it was such a wonderful mortgage . Maybe , uh , the bank will , uh , come and throw us all out . I 'd like to get rid of this house . It 's old fashioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that should give you an idea of my mother 's condition . Mrs .

Certainly . I 'll get back to your , um ... All right . I went to a church because I was a confused stranger down there . And a ... a church is , um , a traveler 's aide to people who do n't , uh , know which way to turn . That would straighten out a lot of people . Oh , yeah . They ... they should try the church .

They may die to make men free . There they are , yeah . They called me from San Francisco . What fight they had . Do you remember , John , hm ? Yes , dear . Many is the game they pulled out of the fire when time was running out . When time was running out , John . Yes . You never played , did you ? No , dear . I think sometimes it hurt you when your father and I jumped up and down cheering for them . Which you remember that I whispered to you , " keep on studying , there are other goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ben and Chuck again .

Attention , please . Flight 92 for Lisbon now boarding at the concourse gate number 20 . All aboard flight 92 , please . Hello . Yeah . John ? I understand you 're on your way to Lisbon . Huh ? Well , what happened ? Not going . Passenger John Jefferson , the plane for Lisbon is leaving immediately from gate number 20 . What time to make a big decision . Well , do you want to come over here and let me help you make it ? By yourself . Well , John , I do n't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Well , uh ... No , we do n't make deals . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Judas . Passenger Jefferson , this is the final call . John , does anyone else know you 're not going to Lisbon ? Now listen , John , use whatever free will you have left to make your own decision and get over here . All right . All right . What is the deal ? Well ... Do we make out a warrant ? Maybe . Maybe we do . Why , John , what an honor ! Oh , I 'd give my life to make you truthful . I 'm cheering for you this time , John . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm cheering for you now . Go on , rise to it . You can do it . I mean , everybody has some purpose in life , even Judas . John , I do n't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ?

Well , John , look , I warned you about us making any kind of deals bec ... John . John ! Yes , and someone else can hear you , too . John , get out of there as fast as you can .

I 'll get right over there . If I think the students should hear it , they 'll hear it . I might add that , um , he was to have been given the honorary degree of doctor of laws this day . So the , um , speech was found in his office by the federal bureau of investigation . You will now hear it verbatim as recorded by John Jefferson , class of 1941 . Members of the graduating class and their fathers and mothers . I mention your parents because I address you as representing their tomorrows . Sometimes this day is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , it will be both , but my life will be altogether different from yours . By now , a plane has arrived in Lisbon . It would have carried me far beyond the laws of my native land , but no plane , no means of transportation , nothing can take a man away from himself . He lives with himself day and night . His conscience lives with him , its voice will not be stilled . Mine warned me that I would not be free in Lisbon , that I would only find my freedom here . So here I stand . Hardly believing that but a few years back i sat down there in my cap and gown , like all of you . I looked like you then . I felt like you feel today , ready to go forward , full of zeal , full of purpose . I was going to help make a better world . I was flattered when I was immediately recognized as an intellect . I was invited to homes where only superior minds communed . It excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have dreamed of when I lived at home . A bold defiance of the only authorities my church , and my mother and father . I know that many of you have experienced that stimulation . But stimulants lead to narcotics . As the cellar of habit forming dope gives the innocent their first inoculations with a cunning worthy of a serpent . There are other snakes lying in wait to satisfy the desire of the young to dedicate themselves to something positive , to give their existence purpose . And the lure is to every young American 's sense of justice , their love of fair play that makes all decent men rebel against the evil forces that exploit the weak . With the purest and noblest motives , we eagerly embrace an organized , definite , and active movement to alleviate the suffering all around us . Our beautiful liberalism is now aroused and we have faith in ourselves , our comrades . Somewhere along the line , our brain has been numbed so that we have substituted faith in man for faith in God . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . They have observed your abilities and seen qualities that I once possessed . It 's too late to save me . It is not too late for you to save yourselves . No one warned me as solemnly as I am warning you now . Hold fast to honor , it 's sacred . No one tried to live the part they wrote for me more than I did . But living it with no spiritual compass , i lost all sense of direction . Any means justified their ends . Shameless falsehood , self-abasement , treachery . And before I realized the enormity of the steps i had taken , i was an enemy of my country and the servant of a foreign power . Now you know that the honor conferred upon me in this citation is false . Every word in it is a lie because I am a living lie . I am a traitor . I am a native American communist spy . And may God have mercy on my soul .

Greece , but I ca n't find it on the map . Lamia ? And I thought that .. Has anyone told , Evelyn ? ' Not yet . ' I better tell her . I will . What does it matter where they die ?

When I was knocking around Australia .. ... I picked it up . Did you work in Australia , some kind of job . You think I never worked in my life , do n't you ? Well I did n't work much in Australia , but I 've worked . Just that never knowing when you 're going to get called up . What 's the use of starting a job you 're going to leave . Besides .. ...

You love Mark , and you write to him and .. - I do n't know . - Oh , it 's still lonely . But you 're right , I am luckier than you and Anne .

My sister and I went back there to school . - We 're glad you 're here . - Thanks . The way the Japanese kept coming down the map . We were beginning to get afraid . Well , if we were n't afraid we were lonely . Honestly . - All squared away , sir . - Good . It 's nice to have talked to you . My name 's Evelyn . Evelyn Leslie .

Five bucks if you can make him smile . Order us a couple of whiskeys , will ya ? - But Andy -- - Come on , honey . Oh , De . - I 'm sorry . - Why ? Being thrust at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very subtle . He 's made it his primary mission in life to get me a girl . He seems to think I need the same kinda set up like he has with Delia . Delia is my sister . - Sorry . - And I 'm married . Congratulations . It 's funny you know . You Americans coming here sweeping all before you with you charm and your money . Then you look down on the girls who are nice to you . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm sorry I sound dreadful .. No , no , I understand , you 've had it up to here . They 're not like this at home . Delia 's not like this at home either . In war , I guess nobody 's really at home . Is your husband .. Last time I heard North Africa . Wow ! That 's a great game of musical chairs .

Oh , steward . - What do you want to drink ? - I 'll have a whiskey . Four whiskeys , please . Hey , five . Closing down your drinking places the way you do at 6:00 makes everybody tank up before sundown . Do you want a cigarette ? Yes , thank you . Keep ' em . Legal tender of the occupying army .

I wish I could go home . I hope your husband 's alright . He 's very lucky . Thank you . Dear Mark , I love you and I miss you . And as I read our poems each night I am close to you and think of you . And I 'm grateful that I have you to keep me .. To keep me what ? To keep me decent . It 's not decent , it 's not decent or proper the behavior of these .. Well , is it decent ? What 's happened to De , and the way they act . Nothing happened to Delia .

Pigs . - Thank you . - Do n't mind my friend , miss . He did n't even wear shoes before he joined the marines . - Pig . Come on . - This is what they call sheer . This man that Delia 's with I suppose he calls her pig . Your sister a pig . I do n't think so . I ca n't understand you , Barbara . I just know they were happy together . Happiness . But what about decency ? Stop using that word . I 've been thinking about writing to the papers about the way they behave . Been other letters on the subject . - Oh , Ann . - I 'm going to . Nice girls with husbands and sweethearts away at war . - Pigs . - It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their husbands looked like . Try to understand them . I know you do n't think I can . Yes ?

It 's your letter in the paper today headquarters is very upset about it . Did n't realize it would attract such attention . I have been instructed to say that America appreciates deeply the courtesies your country has extended us . We know our intrusion is bound to cause friction . ' We regret that . Indeed we do . ' Oh , thank you . Wo n't you come in ? Thanks . Headquarters wants to know if you wish to make any specific complaint . No , I 'm sorry , I really do n't . Thanks for taking that attitude . That 's very generous of you . I 'm sure they have reasons . Men away from home .. You people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . I 'm sure the boys that you 've entertained did n't act the way these men did in the store . The truth is that we have n't entertained any . I suppose we should have . You see , both our parents are dead and it makes it a little more difficult . You have a lovely place . It 's like an English cottage . Yes , you said you had been in England , did n't you ? Yes , I-I was at Oxford , I was a Rhode scholar . Well .. Have you , I mean , I suppose you 've had lots of invitations . Actually none since your little sister 's that first day . ' Anne , who is it ? ' Well , that was my fault I 'm afraid . But you all did seem rather overwhelming that day , right ? I guess we did . You thought that we 'd bring our trucks to dinner or something . I do n't know what 's for supper but you can come if you like .. ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I 'm afraid I trapped you into that invitation . We usually have supper at 6:30 .

He said that the boys who were entertained by families here acted better . - Thought we ought a do our bit . - Of course . We 'll have coffee in the other room by the fire . Can I help with the dishes ? What 's the matter ? - That 's women 's work . - Oh , not where I come from . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime for a man to wash dishes ?

Obviously this is where I 'm supposed to sit . - It was dad 's chair . - And Marks . Well , I 'm an unworthy successor but I wo n't complain . Capt . Bates , what color do you want to be ? What do you mean ? Well , this is Mark . And this is Shiner . He 's Delia 's husband . That 's our sister in Wellington . This is where dad 's ship sank . And this is Tommy . A friend of mine . You can be purple , orange , pink . I do n't think I really belong up there . Why not this green one to match your uniform ? I still do n't think Irate it , but thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 'd you hang my coat ? - Oh , you 're not going ? - No . It 's in the hall . Evelyn , come and help me do the cleaning . - Oh , no please don't . - You can clean up later . I want to look at him . I have something for you . Probably wrong kinds . Perfume but it 's all PX had . You can give ' em to someone else . Not me . Evelyn , if I remember right , this is spring fancy . - Very appropriate . - Thank you . Barbara , here 's something called heaven scent . S-C-E-N-T . Did you know this is the first present I 've had from a man ? Well , it 's about time . And because you 're the one who invited me , Anne . This is called , believe it or not , merci bien . ' Or as we say in Oklahoma , thanks a lot . ' I 'm sorry . Well , it 's ... it 's just that today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting gifts from you Americans , you know ? Americans like to give gifts . Oh , you 're very generous . But it 's all got involved with .. ... well .. What do I do now ? You said you could wash dishes . I 'm sorry , Barbara . It 's just that , he was , well , so nice . And all of a sudden those presents from the PX and then we were like the other girls scavenging from Americans . My mother always taught my sisters it was alright to accept the following gifts from a man candy , flowers and perfume . Even asked him to dinner that very first day . Come on . Wonder where . - ' He 'll be back . ' - ' Of course . ' No rumors even to go by . At the shop today , they said our troops are farther west then that in North Africa . - Oh , where ?

This is sure an upside down country . How 'd you find I was here ? I asked . Why ? I wanted to know . - How are you ? - Oh , I 'm fine . Do n't let this thing on my eyes frighten you . They 'll be fine . They do n't want me looking at things yet . I 'd like to come and read to you if they allow . - Sure . - Or write letters for you . Thanks . - Barbara , Barbara . - Hmm . Are you awake ? Well , I am now . What is it ? - You would never believe it . - Believe what ? - Iceberg Anne . - Who ? Anne . She 's out front nicking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now go to sleep . I think it 's wonderful . Our Anne and an American . Evelyn , do you know what a peeping Tom is ? How am I ever going to learn anything ? Believe me . Not by watching . - Is she going to marry him ? - None of our business . Now get back to bed . Go on . Scoot . Tell me , what do you think of all the marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls ? I do n't think you wan na know what I think . I think you wan na tell what you think . One girl married a man from California . When she got there , she took one look at his home and turned right around and came back . Could happen . I-I have n't heard of anyone who went to your state Oklahoma and came back . That 's nice to know . Tell me , do you approve of these marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls ? Evelyn , curiosity killed the cat . And satisfaction brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Barbara if it 'd be alright for me to marry Anne . You seem to be the most concerned . - So do I have your permission ? - You bet . Do we have your permission too , Barbara ? Of course . When ? Where ? How ? What are the particulars ? Well , there 's only one particular . Admiral Halsey . Permission ? Yes , but I 'll start the machinery tomorrow . - Give us a little warning . - It 'll be a while yet . Sometimes they act a little faster for men who may be moving north . Nobody knows when , but the press would .. Well , I will be going sometime . So if you 'd like to think it over , Barbara . You and Anne have thought it over . That 's the only important thing . Perhaps they 'll decide to leave you behind this time . And anyway , we have until you sail . ' Along with the displeasure of the point of attack ' ' of theAmerican marines ' ' came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine landing on Tarawa ' ' may perhaps be the costliest operation ' ' to date in the Pacific War . ' ' Early reports indicate that the landing was a Persian force ' ' with the marines having to dig in on the beaches ' ' only a few feet from the point of landing . ' Tarawa . That 's where they 've gone . Where 's that ? One of the Gilbert Islands . It was due north . I 've never heard of it . First reports of casualties .. No names yet , just fantastic numbers . Richard will be alright . When he comes back , permission will have to have gone through . You 'll be married and it wo n't all be so rushed . Barbara , I 'm going to have a baby . Oh , Anne . Dick will come through alright . We both knew the ships were sailing soon , some other island . Anne , you do n't have to justify yourself to me . Everything 's changed so much . The way I used to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course it 's convenient for me to understand her now . Makes me feel a little less alone and guilty . Darling .. What should we do , Barbara , if Dick does n't get back ? He will . It would be unfair if this family loses anyone else . If he does n't , I 'd like to have the baby here if you let me . Let you ? Whose home do you think this is ? How Delia would laugh . I do n't think so . I 'd like to phone Delia . Oh ... I wo n't say anything about Dick and .. Well ... I wo n't say anything probably , but .. ... just to talk to her . Suddenly feel I want to talk to her . Hello , I want a personal call , please . To Mrs . Delia Friskett at the St .

Iceberg Anne went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so ... swell . Why ? Because ... Anne 's going to have a baby . Oh ! Alright , I 'll do what you say . I wo n't walk with Americans till I 'm 17 . What 's this about Americans ? I just met a nice Yank . We 've been walking together . Let 's agree on one thing . If you wan na talk to a soldier you 'll bring him home to meet us . That 's fair enough . Anne , you ruined it . She just promised not to see any Americans until she was 17 . But , Barbara , she 's almost grown . - Hello . - Hello . - This is a surprise . - Yes . I met this officer up in Wellington when I went to see Delia . For about ten minutes . Uh , I 'm looking for Anne Leslie . - I 'm Anne Leslie -- - Oh , I 'm sorry . This is my sister . Anne , major .. Harding . Has something happened to Richard Bates ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the hazardous duty of checking on girls that Americans wan na marry .

Oh , and the , uh , the American government out of the goodness of its heart wants to give you this present . Oh , thank you . If you 're going to live in Oklahoma we want you to learn about it . We give lectures for brides-to-be at the Young Eagles Club . Uh , the lecturer 's a bore , but he means well . I guess all bores do . Well , you can tell your captain that everything 's cleared . He 's at Tarawa . Is there any way you could find out ? They wo n't let us have the casualty list yet . Red tape . You know , I often think that it must be harder on you people . I mean , waiting for word from Africa and now Tarawa . Barbara 's husband was killed last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could you ? Well , do n't forget your homework . Do n't worry . You 'll be in Christchurch for a while then ? I 'll be in and out until they certify me for combat duty again . Why do American lighters always work ? You were very nice to Anne at the meeting tonight . - Thank you . - Line of duty . No , she 's nice . - This Bates .. - He 's nice too . Maybe it will work . It 's more than you think of most of these war marriages I take it ? Mm-hmm . Why ? Because most of the people involved were just lonely . You know these guys come in and they say they never knew what true love was before they met the girl . Well , the truth is , they , they never knew what real loneliness was before they came here . Yeah , but the girls .. Well , it 's a little easier to understand them when you realize that our men have been away for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And hunger , yeah . There you are . Come on , let 's get out of here . Eat , drink and make love , for tomorrow we die . That 's Delia 's way of fighting the loneliness . Yes . Anne 's is another . A different way . But if Richard Bates is dead in Tarawa , where 's she ? She 's gon na have a baby , is n't she ? Yeah . Now , why do I wan na say that 's nice ? ' Cause it is n't nice . Not according to the standards that I was brought up by and you too , I 'm sure . But I wan na say that 's nice . For them to have known , uh the sweetness and the comfort of love before he dies . He must n't be dead . Yeah , but if he is .. ... then the sweetness turns sour . Time will see to that . And Bates ' a nice guy . While he lies dying in a ditch , what 's he gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there you are . Oh , that 's where Delia , Anne and Dick are , but .. ... where are you ? This is what I spend the night with . And no regrets . Oh , I get a gentlemanly hangover in the morning , but no regrets . And nobody gets hurt . What 's the matter ? Nothing . Okay . What 's your solution ? Well , you said it was .. ... three years of hunger and loneliness . I 've got ta go in now . Evelyn 's alone . No , do n't bother . I hope everything 's alright . Thank you . What do you do now ? Go to your quarters and get drunk ? - Cold-blooded , is n't it ? - Yes . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . Barbara , uh , this is Max . - Max Murphy . - Hi . Hello , Max . Babs , Max thinks you make wonderful cakes . - Oh , yeah , they 're great . - Well , thank you . I was just down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're indoctrinating prospective American brides . Are you one of them ? No . Just curious . You sure do n't look like most of them look . I saw the last bride ship leave for the States . I would n't touch ' em with someone else 's ten-foot pole . - Have another cake , Max . - Oh , that 's alright . You know , I think most of the guys just got hooked . - Some gratitude . - Gratitude ? For what , Max ? Oh , I mean , savin ' your country . Oh , well , were you at Guadalcanal , Max ? Well , no . I just come off from Hawaii a couple of weeks ago . Oh ! But I 'm away from home now , for over a year , training ' . - Have you now ? - Have you really ? Yeah , it 's been plenty rugged . Anne , this is Max . Max Murphy . - Hello , Max . - Anne . Barbara . Oh , Evelyn , you entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I do n't know . I think your sister Barbara 's mad at me . That crack about the bride ship . - No . - Is she married , Barbara ? - She 's a widow . - Oh ! What about Anne ? Is Anne married ? Anne 's ... not married . ' You 've changed the way you wear your hair . ' When I left it was different . Or is this an optical illusion ? Can I cut in ? Thank you . - Hello , where have you been ? - Up in Wellington . - Investigating brides ? - Yup . Same hazardous mission . Oh , did you see Delia by any chance ? No . - How 's Anne ? - Fine . I understand that the permission for her marriage came through a week ago . It 's filed . - Does she hate Dick Bates now ? - No . - Herself ? - No , nobody . That 's nice . Has she been advised of her rights ? What do you mean ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the illegitimate -- We do n't need that . Thank you . We do n't like thinking of it in that way . Alright . However , it 's nice of them setting up a board to have the whole thing organized . Anne may not hate anybody , but you do , do n't you ? No . Just the war . Sorry . What are you doing here anyway ? I did n't think you came to dances . It 's part of my job to show up at this .. How about you ? Oh , I 'm chaperone , you know . Old married woman . Who chaperones the chaperons ? - No , did someone bring ya ? - No . ' Barbara . ' I told you that practice is gon na pay off , huh ? Just stay loose , kid , ' cause here I go . Whole new bunch got in today . Most of mine leave from the forward areas . Oh ! And tomorrow morning the office will be swarming with guys with hangovers muttering that they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry the girl . I 've got a car with some $100 punch in the glove compartment . - Would you like to , uh .. - No , thank you . Okay . So you 're still carrying on your hot affair with the bottle ? Yup . I 'll hear from that in the morning . And what will you say to him ? Same thing my father said to me when I wanted to get married . Oh ! I met my wife .. ... during Easter vacation in Bermuda . I was a senior in college . I 'd never seen her before . The setting was perfect . Just like this one . The girl was beautiful . And there she was shimmering in the moonlight . Do n't make fun of it . Maybe I should n't . Well , my father .. " What do you know about the girl ? What she likes and dislikes ? " " Dad , " I said , " she likes to kiss in the moonlight . " And she dances like a dream . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be again . " Sounds lovely . Yup , and so they were married . Six years later they became a statistic in the divorce records . I loved her , but I did n't like her . And she liked me , but she did n't love me . How was a guy supposed to know ? So , do you tell the boys that once back in Bermuda there was a moon like this one a girl you 'd only known for a week , et cetera , et cetera ? No . But I try to talk some sense into them . Like recommending the bottle . - Somehow that 's cheating . - What ? The bottle . How ? Removing you from it all . Might make you slightly patronizing to the boys who are not afraid to get involved . I 'm sorry . Barbara . Yes . I do n't .. I do n't love you . I know . And I do n't want to marry you . But I .. Oh , my darling . ' Our neighbor across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and she 's not gon na do it this year . Her contribution to the war effort . Well , ready for the lights . Oh , Anne , we 're gon na light the tree . - ' Coming . ' - Would you get the light ? Oh , how lovely . Ooh , see the pretty tree . See that ? Oh , do you remember ? Father always said something at this moment . You do it , Anne . God rest all the men who fought for us all over the world . God rest the Americans who were with us ' and the nice one's who 've been to our house . ' Dick and ... John . Evelyn , uh , should we include Max Murphy ? No , he was a drip . Tommy will be home soon . And God rest all those that have gone . Mother , dad .. Kid .. Dick .. And Mark . ' And may the war end quickly ' and may everyone come home . Well , that 's all in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Well .. I just hope that when all this is over we 'll have a world where .. ... where he can grow up and grow old . ' Where he can become , well , a fine boy .. ' ... a husband , father , grandfather . Whatever else he wants to become . Did you hear that ? You 're going to become a grandfather . ' It 's almost midnight now . ' and Christmas starts around here at dawn . You could sleep here . Kid used to bunk out here . And once in a while Dick Bates . Take a look at the view . Remember , Barbara , we 'd lie here and look out .. ... and you 'd tell me things . Yes , I remember . So , it 's all set up . You 'll stay ? I 'm afraid not , Evelyn . I have to report back to the base tonight . Oh , gosh . Oh , I 've got ta help Anne . She 's absolutely no good at changing nappies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her how to change a baby . ' Night .

Discovered he raided a marine major and did n't have one -- - Whereabouts , do you know ? - I do n't know . Up north of here around Ulithi I guess . I 'm really not very happy about it . I 'm not a sea-going marine sitting around doing staff duty . It 'll be better than investigating prospective brides . Maybe . Thank you for my lighter . Merry Christmas . Happy New Year . I wish I had stuck to my bottle . Do you ? Really ? I do n't know . I , I know what you mean but these have been nice months . I think we 've both been .. ... a little less lonely .

Wiser , yeah . No sadder ? I do n't know where I 'm going . I do n't know what 's gon na happen . I suppose , sooner or later we 're gon na have to land on the Jap mainland .. Well , if that happens , it 'll make Guadalcanal and Tarawa and the rest of them look like kid stuff . But , at least .. ... it wo n't be like with the others .

No , I 'll take care of everything . Yes . I carry insurance on Clayton and remember our motto , " If there 's anything wrong , we make it Wright . " " If there 's anything wrong , we make it Wright . " Well , everything is all wrong now , Mr Wright . Everything is , and everybody . It 's a mess ! My beautiful fish . My beautiful dog .

Say , you 're not mad at me because I saved you , are you ? Nah . Besides , I could n't be mad around this place , anyhow . It sure is a romantic spot , ai n't it ? Yeah , Carla and I used to come here all the time . - Carla and you . - Yeah . We were just kids when I carved our initials in this tree . Gee , we used to have an awful lot of fun here . When we were kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it is now . To us at that time , this was ... Well , like a fairyland . There 's a summery breeze playing songs in the trees Dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dah Nature has its own band And the music is grand In the Land of La La La Dipping peppermint creams into chocolate streams There is no one who 'll snitch to Ma You can dip with each hand Eat until you expand In the Land of La La La All the clouds are cotton candy and handy to try If you feel like having luncheon start munching ' the sky It 's a fabulous place Put a smile on your face Close your peepers And there you are If you 're ready to start Hop a rainbow cart Your heart will shout , Hurrah ! Just give me your hand We 're off to the Land The Land of La La La La , La , La , La , La La , La , La , La , La In the Land of La La La Well , I guess it 's just a crazy kid 's song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to come here and talk all the time about one day getting married and having children . But I guess I 'll never have any . Well , not the way you 're going , you wo n't . Come on , Sandy . You 're a little girl yourself . Yeah , but have n't you heard that one little girl in the bush is worth two in Hollywood ? Hollywood ! That reminds me . You said Carla sent me something . What was it ? Carla , that 's all you can think of ! Come on , Sandy , what is it ? Sandy ? It 's a photograph . It 's in the truck . An autographed photograph ? Did she sign it ? Did she sign it herself ? Did you see her do it personally , or did her secretary do it ? I did n't see Carla , I was ... She was gone by the time I got to Hollywood . You did n't see her ? You were there all summer . Well , I stayed in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I wanted you to miss me and even had my teeth capped by Carla 's dentist . And I come back and kiss you , and you did n't even notice the difference . But I did . I did notice the difference , Sandy . Honest . I was wondering where that funny little whistle was every time you talked . And really , I did miss you , Sandy . - Did you really miss me , Tiger ? - Well , sure . You play softball better than anybody I know . Some Tiger . I should have drowned him . " To Clayton . I have been thinking a lot about you lately . " " Signed , Carla . " She 's been thinking about me . Oh , boy . I wonder why she 's been thinking about me . Is it a boy or a girl ? Well , right now they all look like Yul Brynner . All ? Well , what do you mean ? Could be a boy and a girl and one to spare . Harold , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First time out , a DeMille production . Oh , how wonderful . Oh , but poor Clayton . Now , come on , Carla , come on . Do n't kiss me in front of everybody . All the photographers are watching . Come on , Carla . Life goes to a party , but this is ridiculous . Hello , darling . Oh , it 's you . Well , you do n't have to sound that disappointed . After all , I 'm a woman with the same blood in my veins as my sister . What do you want ? Well , my television does n't work , and I want you to come over and fix it . At 1:30 in the morning ? Carla 's first movie is coming on the Late-Late-Early-Late Show .

Wait a minute , what about your father ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kalabriasz at the firehouse . He wo n't be home for hours . Okay . I 'll be right over . Bye . Kalabriasz . I 'll be able to see her in a movie . Movies , movies . Oh , Carla . Okay , Judge , that 's two beans more you lose . - Gigi Naples , he 's lucky at cards . - Not so loud , Gigi . You wan na wake up the hook-and-ladder boys ? You wo n't be so lucky when you get Clayton Poole for a son-in-law . That 's not funny . Take that back . Now easy , Gigi . Ca n't you take a joke ? I take a joke , but that jerk is no joke . He make my Carla full of big ideas to be a big movie star , so she leaves her papa . All right , now you leave the judge alone , Gigi .

Now you can put this boy in office , and take my word for it , he 'll do a job for this community and for every home and every family , and in every pot there 's gon na be plenty .

Drink it , right now . C - H-l-C-K-O-R-Y Why , why , why , why use any old brand of coffee ? - Get that Chickory flavour - Chickory flavour Drink that Chickory coffee I brought the keys , Miss Bessie . Folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying big worrisome x-ray bills , it 's because you 're smoking ordinary cigarettes . Smoke the new milder Filter Tip Superbos , now with a cork tip at one end and a filter tip at the other . - Smoke , smoke Superbos - Superbos The modern filter tip cigarette Is your stomach dragging ? Friends , remember Burperex . One little Burperex tablet will keep your tum-tum from going on the dum-dum . Take Burperex Do n't let your tum-tum go on the dum-dum I 'm leaving now , Miss Bessie . Burperex Now back to our first-run silent movie of the evening , starring John Bunny and Flora Finch , brought to you by Old Chickory-Flavoured Coffee , Superbo Filter Cork Ends and Burperex for the tum-tum . Miss Bessie , I 'm awfully sorry that I interrupted you during the commercials . You know I believe in loyalty to the sponsor . That 's what 's wrong with the world today , not enough loyalty . That 's why you 're leaving town , because you 're loyal to your first love . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ready for the next tenant . And I 'll come by and pick up my things later . You decided where you 're going yet ? I do n't know . I thought maybe I 'd hitch a ride up the Old Lake Road and maybe go to Chicago or somewhere . If you 're interested in what an old lady thinks ... Oh , watch it , Miss Bessie . Well , you know I 'm always interested in what you think . Well , if you want to know what this old lady thinks , she thinks it 's about time you got out of Midvale . Forget this Carla , find someone else . Oh , Claytie , you 've been like a son to me , running to the market every time one of those TV fellas says , " Go to the market and get some . " I 'll never forget you , Claytie . Goodbye , Miss Bessie . Are n't they the most wonderful little things in the world , Harold ? They prove tequila does n't hurt the birth rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , let 's hope we catch that joker so you can leave them . Are we anywhere near the Old River Road yet ? Miss Bessie must have told you the Old Lake Road . Maybe . It was hard to understand that old doll with her TV blasting and with her eating raviolis and chewing bubblegum at the same time . - Does she always smoke cigars ? - Only when they 're sponsored . Oh , do n't drive so fast , Harold . I know where we 'll find Clayton . When you love in vain Love is a lonely thing Like an endless chain You keep remembering All the countless times You thought you caught her eye How she passed you by Almost unaware that you were there But when she takes your hand Then it 's a lovely thing Flowers dot the land And all at once it 's spring You hold her in your arms And then she whispers low I love you , love you When you 're dreaming Love 's a lonely thing Hello , Clay . Carla ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it . ' Cause whenever I come here I see you all over the place , but it 's never really you . It has been a long time . Let 's sit . There 's something in my eye . Quiet , you little schedule-breakers . Your mother 's busy lining up a six-months ' baby-sitter . You have n't forgotten me , Clay ? Forgotten you ? No , I have n't forgotten you , Carla . As far back as I can remember , you 're all I ever think about . I even remember the color of the dress you wore that Easter Sunday that you made me steal the money from the collection plate to buy the ice cream cone with . And when I got a little older and I gave the money back , then I joined the Camp Fire Girls just so I could be near you . Remember when my voice started to change and they threw me out ? I remember . I was a terrible child . No , you were n't , Carla . Really , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go for a guy like me , that looked like me . I even took a muscle-building course so that you would n't laugh at me when we went swimming . That did n't do very much good , because I could n't find my muscles to build them up . That was n't the main trouble , anyhow . The trouble was my face . And I could n't wait until hair would grow on it so no one would have to see it . I had that beard long before that Schweppes man , remember ? I remember it all . And , well , I ca n't sleep just dreaming about you , Carla . Matter of fact , I dream about you every night . Same silly dream . I 'm Sir Galahad in shining Armour , and you 're always in trouble and you need me . How right you are . And in the very same dream , I always come up charging on the white horse to save you from the terrible trouble . So , how could you say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could forget you . Except , look , I 'm taking you with me so I ca n't forget you . I 'm taking you with me so I ca n't forget you . I 'm not just crazy about you , Carla . I 'm just plain crazy . What 's the matter , Carla ? Did I say something wrong ? If I did , I 'm awfully sorry . No . Everything you said was beautiful , sweet . Well , you see , Carla , I have n't got anyone I can talk to about you . You know , your father does n't want your name mentioned , and Sandy is jealous , and Miss Bessie ... Well , the whole town thinks I 'm a fool because I keep thinking about you , and I guess that 's why I gushed the way I did just now . I 'm awfully sorry . I was n't even polite enough to ask you what you were doing here . I came to ask a favour , but I 've changed my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came to ask me a favour ? I ca n't do it , Clay . Why not , Carla ? You can do anything you want to me . Do n't you remember when you were 15 , at your birthday , when you pushed me into the birthday cake with all your lit candles and it burned the fuzz on my face ? And then I set fire to the barber shop ? And did I get mad , Carla , when your father chased me around the square with the razor ? Carla , you 're in trouble . I could always tell when you were in trouble . Now , what 's the matter ? Clay , please . Forget I was here . But , Carla , you can trust me . I mean , if you need me , you know I 'll do anything you want . I hoped all my life I could do something for you . - Just give me a chance to prove it . - I ca n't , Clay . But I 'll do anything you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my children ? It 's simple . You just say , would you ... Did you really say , would you be the father of my ... Oh , Clayton ! Oh , Clayton ! Harold ! Harold ! He 's drowning , Harold . Hurry . Miss Bessie ! Miss Bessie ! Miss ... Oh , I 'm ... Miss Bessie ! Miss Bessie ! The squirt spray and the curlers at the low introductory price ... Miss Bessie , did you rent the apartment yet ? I did n't think you 'd get very far , Clayton . - When you 're loyal , you 're loyal . - Thanks a lot , Miss Bessie . And everything will be ... Yes , the old Grey hair ai n't what it used to be - Do n't delay , get Gookum Spray today - Gookum I better get out of these clothes . If I catch a cold , I 'll give it to my son . I ca n't have that happen . Let 's see now . I keep the baby until they return from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to leave her son with me . Poor Carla 's husband . He never even saw the baby . He died the next morning , right after the honeymoon . What a way to go . What 'll I wear ? What 'll I wear ? What a nervous wreck I am . I ca n't wait for my child . You should have told him he was going to have a full house . He thought it was only one . I did n't want to scare him out . - Did you give him the money ? - He would n't take it . He said unless he did it all himself , it would n't be important . Well , the boy has character . I remember I had it once . The baby 's here . He 's here . Oh , boy . The baby ... Calm , calm . I must be calm . I got ta make believe like I 'm completely surprised , in case anybody 's watching . Oh , my heavens . A baby 's cry . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at this hour ? I shall look . Oh , goodness , goodness . A child . Alas and alack . What would a baby be doing here ? Well , certainly ca n't stay out in the night air . Do n't cry , baby . You 'll get used to me . How does a baby cry while he 's asleep ? Twins . Your mommy did n't tell me there were two of you . Gee , I sure hope I can take care of the two of you . No . Oh , no . Do you think it ... No , it ca n't be . You guys are n't old enough to be going around knocking on doors . Nah . Just someone . Hello ? Who ? Knocking ? Hello ? Hello ? Three . One , two , three . One . God bless you . Triplets . That 's three of you and only one of me . But I 'll try . I 'll really try . Do n't cry , honey . He 'll take good care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I know he will . It 's just that when you see someone who loves you so much , you ... I know . Sometimes one gets too busy to notice . No , it is n't cats . No , I ca n't tell you on the phone . Will you just come right over ? Oh , yeah , and Sandy , one other thing . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stop by the drugstore and pick up some of those bottles with those rubber faucets on the end , you know ? Okay . Goodbye . Now , Sandy is on her way over with your breakfast , but just to tide you over a little bit till she gets here , I 'll warm a little snack for you , okay ? Hold it , hold it . Nice and clean , with sterilizing . Oh , hot . What a heat . What a hot heat . Got ta be clean . Got ta be a clean heat hot . Relax . Relax , kids , relax . Here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll have it in a second . This should work . Well , you ca n't always do it without spilling a little . Here 's nice , nice milk for the boys . Plenty of drinking so they get nice and strong and big . Plenty of milk for the boys . Now we have it nice . Hold it tight , and we have ... Here it comes . It 's starting out . Get set , boys . Sorry , fellas . Here it comes . All right . Wait a minute . Here , we do n't need this . Here , watch it . On the head . Pretty good . Here we go . Go ahead . Here , you want some ? Take a little bit . That 's good . Okay . Go ahead . That 's good . Hello ? Naturally , it 's none of my business , Mr Naples , and heaven knows I 'm not one to talk , but your daughter Sandy received a phone call from Clayton Poole . He has n't left town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How old would you say they are , Sandy ? - About two months . - They 're cute , are n't they ? Yeah . What 's the matter ? Well , now you 'll never have to get married , will you ? - What ? - Well , you always wanted children , and now you got ' em , the easy way . Yeah , well , it ai n't gon na be so easy taking care of them . Would you remind me to call Doc Simkins for their distemper shots ? - What 's so funny ? - That 's for puppies . Clayton , do n't you know anything about little girls ? Little girls ? - Are they all little girls ? - Yes . They told me while we were discussing the latest in fashion . Oh , be careful . Do n't drop him . Her . I wo n't . See , this is the first thing you learn in Home Economics , Clayton . After they eat , they 've got an awful lot of air bubbles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . See how it works ? - Could I try one ? - Sure . - Here , Sandy , hold this . - Okay . Now , that 's it . Now pat her back real easy , very easy . Yeah . I 'm doing it easy . Something 's wrong with this one . It ai n't working . - They all work , Clayton . - Yeah , but I got scared . I did n't know . Say , you 're going to have to get married after all , Tiger . Is getting married all you got on your mind ? Sure , because they are n't going to let you keep them . And if you want a family , you 're still gon na have to invest in a $2 license . I 'm still a contender . And who says I ca n't keep ' em ? I found ' em . The court 's going to find a home for them . They have a home right here with me . They 'll put them with married couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby for a long time . Three married couples could adopt one each . They 're not breaking up the set . They 're staying here with me . - You 're not married , Clayton . - I know that . They 're not going to let a bachelor raise three little girls . Your father was a bachelor . He raised two of them . Really , Clayton . Papa was n't a bachelor . - Sometime I wish I am . - Aw , shut it ... Hi , Papa Naples . - Come in . Come in . - I am in . I told you to keep away from him . Now , go home . Oh , Papa . Why do n't you listen to your father , Sandy ? That 's the first smart thing I ever hear you say . Bravo . Well , being a father now , I understand the problems fathers have . What do you mean ? You a father ? Well , not exactly . It 's just that ... Well , you see ... Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorstep last night . - Are n't they cute ? - You be quiet . Where they come from ? Oh , well , Papa , like Sandy said , someone left them on my doorstep , and that 's ... Such sweet bambinos . Nice babies . Can I hold one ? Yeah . Take your pick . Come here , come here . Come , nice babies . Hey , Papa , look . That baby looks just like you . - Yeah ? - No , it does n't ! - Look like me , huh ? - No . That 's right , bambino does look just like me . No , the bambino do n't look like you at all , Papa . Sure she does . Bambino just look like Papa . Just look like ... Oh , Papa , wash your mind out with soap . I was in Hollywood having my teeth capped . No , no , no . Oh , no , Papa , no . Not a very original quote , but I still think he has character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks holding them . Cute ? You 're not starting to go for this local , are you ? Can you think of anyone who 'd make a better father ? Look at that honest face . - Ready for the next shot , Carla . - Be right there . Do n't bother me today . Blondine tint contains a non-habit forming detergent bleach with activated radiation that ... Dormi , dormi , dormi Good night and sleep well , my love Dormi , dormi , dormi Angels are watching above Till the dawn on tiptoe Steals over your window sill May every bright star attend thee And befriend thee with its light This little song may I send thee Dormi , dormi , my love , good night Every little bambino yearn For the little song that he learns Long before he learns that the world 's a balloon To each little note that I sing I have tied a dream with a string There are dream running all through the tune Dormi , dormi , my love Good night How come you know that song ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear you sing it all the time to Sandy when she was a baby . Oh , I remember . - Babies are nice , eh , Clayton ? - Yeah . Well , they 're more than that to me , Papa Naples . I 've never been needed before and now I have three people that need me . - They 're small , but they need me . - To be needed is a good thing , but no so good when they do n't need you . Oh , Papa , you mean Carla . But Carla needs you , Papa . It hurts . I always blame you because Carla go away , but it 's not your fault . She leave home because ... Because I am bad papa . Oh , no , do n't say that . You were n't a bad father , Papa Naples . Yes , yes , yes . I was too strict . I want to keep my Carla with me so I not be lonely . But now , I am no lonely no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You still have Sandy . Nah , nah , nah . I am no lonely no more because maybe I feel I am gon na be a grand papa . Maybe I am grand papa already , eh ? Well , what do you ... No , well ... Oh , no , now wait a minute , Papa Naples . No , now , Sandy and I are friends , like pals and ... It 's like two fellas . There 's no things there . I mean , Sandy is my friend , platonic pal . You saw the caps . I no mean Sandy . Take a look . - You take this picture , Papa ? - Yes , I take . Well , why did you take only one ? There 's three here . When I take that picture , there was not three , there is only one . Name is Carla . This a picture of Carla as a baby , huh ? The same . Exact duplicate like your babies , eh ? Well , it 's like a coincidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... - You are good boy . Carla , she get in trouble , so you take care of her . I do n't know what you mean , Papa . She can trust you , because you good boy . Good night , my sweet grandchildren . God keep you forever . - Clayton . - Yes , Papa Naples . - I sorry I call you meat head . - Oh , that 's okay . Anytime you need an old babysitter , you call me . I work for nothing . Goodbye , Mr Vulmenaylo . Sweet little girl . Was n't it ? Oh , we 're so nice and clean . Oh , how cute . On a little platter . Just like a little pheasant . Nice and tender and warm . Sweetheart ? Baby ? How do you lose a child in it ? Honey . Where 's the child ? Baby ? Where is it ? I lost a baby . I lost a whole child . What happened to the child ? Baby ? Come on , little sweets . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , what pretty babies . Here . Ready ? Smiling ? Here , look here . Here it is . Here it is . There you are , darling . Yeah , was that tickling ? Yes , was it ticklish ? Hello , sweetheart . Well , Clayton , I 've got to hand it to you . You 've just taken wonderful care of those babies . It 's ... Clayton . Now you 're just gon na have to take it easy , Clayton . Doc says you 're suffering from exhaustion . Personally , I think the responsibility of this job is just more than you can handle . Women are built to take such punishment , but not men . Why do n't you get smart , boy , just give ' em up ? The doctor said quiet . Clayton says that he thinks the mother is going to come back for them . That 's why he wants to keep them . I do n't think that excuse is going to hold up , Clayton . Nobody 's ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for babies long ago . I think the judge is just going to make them wards of the court until the adoption proceedings . All right . Relax , Clayton , relax . I 'll talk to the judge .

And , well , this diploma is only awarded to the very best of mothers . I was first in my class for overall child care , and I placed second for formula-mixing .

There was no ... It was a dentist . There was no doctor . Listen , Mr Naples , Your Honour , here . Here 's the caps to prove it . You tell me . Are those bambinos my grandchildren ? Hold on there , Gigi . What 's going on here ? I 'm the judge in this court . That 's right . You are the judge . So if you be a good boy , you can perform the marriage . Marriage ? Me , marriage ?

Papa made me do it to keep anyone else from getting Carla 's babies . Carla 's ... How did you know ? Stop them ! Stop them ! Stop them ! Stop them ! - They ca n't get married . - They are married already . Right , Judge ? - That they are . - But they ca n't be . I just heard it on the newscast .

There he goes . After him , boys . Come back here . You 're going to jail . Sorry , ladies . Well , it 's all out in the open now . The way I see it , you 're the bullfighter 's widow , but you 're also married to Clayton Poole , except that Poole is married to your sister , as well as to you .

Why , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can return them to you personally . What character . All right , easy , boys . Easy . Easy , boys . Miss Naples will give you a statement . Where 's Clayton Poole ?

Clayton is there at the airport with babies . Well , I have n't seen him , Papa . You no recognise Clayton , because Clayton no look like Clayton . Because Clayton , he have to hide from police .

You can see I still have to cast it . Anyway , sculpting is something I do for my own pleasure . Having not yet reached the perfection I seek , I find it quite impossible to give up the completed work , so I 'll keep it . - Oh ? Where ? - Oh , not here . Somewhere I can go occasionally to look at it and ... be reminded of my beautiful young model . - Are you feeling all right ? - Yes , yes , of course . It 's just that I think we ought to go , Pierre . - Would you mind getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... a remarkably fine sculptor , Bonner , do n't you think ? Yes , very fine .

Yes ? Hello , Georges . I saw the statue last night . Why did you lie to me ? Why did n't you want me to know that you 'd started work on it ? Why did you start work on it ? I like to finish what I start . Oh . Is that why you ran away from me in Italy ? Is that what you call finishing what you start ? My holiday was over . I came back to work . - So suddenly ? - Yes , so suddenly . There was a case . It was urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I waited for you to write to me . Then I realised that if I ever wanted to see you again I had to be the one to make the first move . Why ? Why are you so afraid of loving me , Georges ? I watched you towards the end ofthe holiday in Italy and you were like a man heading towards something which he wanted to avoid . I began to think that I 'd won and that you were going to admit to yourselfthat you really loved me . Was I right ? All right , Janine . I did fall in love with you in Italy . This could not be so I left . - Why could n't it be ? - It just couldn't . - But you knew how I felt about you ? - Yes , I knew . And you still ran away from it . I 'm not going to give up so easily , Georges . Oh , tell me you do n't want me to give up . No , I do n't ... Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue again ? Yes . Yes , of course . It 's very lovely . It 's you who are lovely . I only copied . Is it finished ? Nearly . Would you like to pose for me again ? When ? Now . You still have n't accepted that we love each other . Yes , I have . But it does n't make you happy . That 's because it does n't alter things . - What things ? - Oh , the ... the impossibility ofthe situation . ( @knock_at_door ) Come in . The gentleman 's downstairs , sir . Ludwig ! Oh , please excuse me , Janine . I have been waiting so long for Ludwig to arrive . You 'll understand . Ludwig ! Let me ... look at you .

You have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll talk about that later , Ludwig . - Are n't you forgetting something ? - Yes , of course , our little ceremony . I have n't been too well .

The ... The usual toast . - Ludwig , your hand . - Oh , yes , my hand . - Let me have a look at it . - No , it 's not necessary . I had a stroke . That is why I was not here sooner . It has left me with this legacy . - Why did n't you let me know ? - I was frightened to . I hoped you would have found the answer by now . - You have not found it , Georges ? - No .

Three weeks I have been waiting , Ludwig . Three weeks ! I have been taking this fluid every six hours now . Six ? It is what keeps me alive . So you see , you must operate . You ... you know what will happen ifyou do n't . Yes , I know . You will die . You 're old . You can see death staring you in the face . But I ca n't ... I 'm not going to die .

We tell him just enough to satisfy him and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . That 's the best way , Georges . For the first time I 'll be with him to show him what to do . Next time , ifyou still need the operation , I sha n't be here . I 'll be dead . Find someone else ? Huh . It 's easy to say . - There is so little time . - You are a doctor . You must have met other doctors , someone who will do it . ( @knock_at_door , @door_opens ) Mademoiselle Dubois is leaving , sir . Janine . I 'm terribly sorry , Janine . Let me introduce you to my oldest and dearest friend , Ludwig Weiss . Ludwig , this is Mademoiselle Janine Dubois . It is delightful to meet you , my dear . How do you do , Professor ? I 'm sure that you have a lot to talk to the professor about so I 'll say goodbye . - Goodbye , my dear . - I 'll see you at dinner . Janine , why not bring Gerard along this evening ? - Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vienna is here . I 'm sure he would love to meet him . I thought we were going to be on our own tonight . Ludwig is here only for a few days . We 'll have so much time together . Oh , Georges , you do n't know what it means to me to see you again . It means everything to me . This Monsieur Pierre , is he a doctor ? Even better , a surgeon . And ... do you think he 'll do it ? If he 's convinced that you give the operation your blessing , then he 'll do it . Why should he be influenced by what I do ? Ludwig ... Ludwig , you 're still the same . You just can not accept the fact that you are a great man . One ofthe greatest in your own field . There is no medical man in the world who would miss the chance of meeting you , let alone work with you . Half of what makes up this reputation belongs to you , more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Listen , Georges . Why not tell them ? Publish our findings . Please , Ludwig , allow me to decide when to publish . Probably you are right . You have invested more in this than I have . Yes , indeed . Nevertheless , I probably sha n't be here to see the consequences . I am tired , Georges . As you said just now , I can see death staring me in the face . I 'm sorry , Ludwig . Believe me , I did n't mean it that way . Strange , getting old . One suddenly has no future to look forward to and is forced to look back and ... survey the past . Do you remember our original toast , the first time we knew we had succeeded ? Of course I do . Say it . - For humanity . - That 's right . For humanity . Not for me , not for you , Georges , but for all . I know what it means . Do you , Georges ? Sometimes I wonder a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is hardly surprising . I 'm talking about our original ideas , bright , shining ideas , full of hope for a brave new world . What happened to them ? Where did they get lost ? Why ... Why do you say they are lost ? I think they are . The years have brought me an added insight that enables me to see more clearly - the fact ... - Wait a minute , Ludwig . You are forgetting something , are n't you ? I 'm sorry , I do n't understand . - Do you still have that photograph ? - Photo ... photograph ? - Our photograph . - Ah , yes , of course . - Give it to me . - Mm ... Look at it , Ludwig . And what do you see there ? I see the two of us . - As we were at the beginning . - Exactly . So , remember , when you talk ofthis wisdom and this insight that old age has brought to you , remember I too have this wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 . 89 . Have another look . Let it remind you , while you have the wisdom that comes with a life of 89 years , I have that which comes with a life of ... 104 . Yes , sir , I know what you 're saying is possible but it 's not proven . ( Chuckles ) Proven ! If we doctors waited until something is proven before we moved , there 'd be no patients left . They 'd all be dead . Look , I have seen it done in three different ways , none of_them completely effective . - The first is to make an ingress through ... - Ludwig . Just a moment , Georges . An ingress through ... Ludwig , why not take Dr Gerard down to the study ? - It will be so much easier down there . - Yes , of course . Come on . Come on , Dr Gerard . - You 'll excuse us ? - Oh , of course they will . Come on . I 'll get pencil and paper to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incision must be made directly ... Pierre seems very interested in your Professor Weiss . Yes , I told you he would gladly come once you mentioned Professor Weiss of Vienna . He 's a wonderful old man . Have you known him long ? All my life . We ... used to work together . A long time ago . That makes you sound very old . Janine , I ca n't tell you how much it means to me to have you back . I missed you so much . You need n't have . You know that . Yes . Yes , I knew . Georges , you still have n't told me why you tried to avoid falling in love with me . You started telling me something this morning but you never finished it . Because I had to go away . Because I have to go away again . Go away ? Where ? Where is not important . What matters is that I shall have to leave Paris very soon . But you 'll come back ? No . Why ? I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there and tell me you 're going away and never coming back without giving me an explanation . My work makes it necessary . Because you 're a doctor ? Yes , partly . I have to travel where no one has ever been before . I want to lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond . To do this it is necessary for me to go away . Is it necessary for you to go alone ? All right , you 've convinced me but it 's not something I 'd care to try . Ah , you lack the spirit ofthe pioneer , Dr Gerard . Being a surgeon is a practical business . It 's necessary to make a living . It does n't leave much time for pioneering . But ifyou had the opportunity of becoming one ofthe pioneers by performing one simple operation , what would you say then , huh ? First I 'd say that no operation is simple . Then I 'd want to know what this operation involved . If it were impossible to explain it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have to say no . Regardless of who was talking to you ? Professor Weiss , when we started this conversation I was under the impression that we were speaking hypothetically . Are we ? No . We are not . I see . I suppose I should be annoyed at this verbal subterfuge . I do n't know why I 'm not , really . Look , suppose you tell me just exactly what it was you asked me here for . See this ? My right hand . The one I would have used if I were going to operate . I came here for one single reason . To save the life of Georges Bonner . - What ? - Yes . By performing an operation that only I know how to perform . You see ? I ca n't do it . Therefore , I am asking you to take my place . This operation , Dr Weiss , what exactly does it involve ? In spite of what you said , this one is really simple . It involves the removal ofthe uter-parathyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonner 's life . I have n't finished . To remove the gland and substitute an alternative . An alternative ? Why ? Is it necessary to know the reason just to perform an operation ? Physically , no , but morally , I think so . Would you be prepared to leave the protection ofyour morals in my hands ? I ... I 'm not sure . Look at it this way . I am asking you to perform a very simple , straightforward operation and I am guaranteeing to you there can be no ill effects . On the contrary , unless this operation is done , and very soon , Georges Bonner ... will die . I agree that the operation is simple . I would n't exactly call it straightforward . - It 's never been done before . - Actually , I 've done it myself many times . - You 've done it ? - Mm . There are no moral or legal aspects involved . I suppose not , as long as the patient is willing . He is willing . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . - And will you lend your name to this ? - Mm . Very well , I 'll do it . Good . Now , come on . I 'll show you what 's to be done . Thank you . This is Georges Bonner 's laboratory , where we will do the operation . Would n't it be better in a theatre next door to the clinic ? No , no , it 's better here . We do n't want people to know the doctor is sick . It 's bad for the morale ofthe patients . ( Chuckles ) - That 's a fine piece of work , is n't it ? - Mm-hm . Oh , Georges , I love you so much . And I love you . I 've tried not to . I 've tried very hard . Is it so bad now you 've given up the struggle ? I do n't think I could have let you go . I 'm not going to let you , ever . ( Ludwig ) Georges , Dr Gerard must go now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you 'd better let Gerard take you home . Whatever you say , Georges . It 's been a very great honour to meet you . My colleagues will be most impressed . Please , Dr Gerard , I must ask you not to mention our meeting . You see , I am old and tired . if_the medical fraternity knew I was here , they would request lectures , addressed meetings . Oh , you understand of course . As you wish . I 'm sorry about this , Bonner , but I have to go back to the hospital . - Thank you for coming . - Not at all . - Will you see me home first , Pierre ? - Yes , of course . ( @doorbell_rings ) - Dr Bonner , please . - Yes ? I am Inspector Legris ofthe Surete . I wonder if I could have a word with you . Of course , Inspector . Come in . Thank you . - Evening , Mademoiselle , Messieurs . - ( All ) Evening . - We were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't leave on my account . Oh , we can wait a few more moments , ca n't we , Pierre ? - Come into the study , Inspector . - Thank you . - Sit down , please . - Thank you . What can I do for you , Inspector ? Just a couple of questions , sir . Routine . Relating to what ? Relating to the apparent disappearance of a young lady , one Margo Philippe . Did you say Margo ? But that 's impossible . - You do know the young lady , then ? - Oh , yes . Yes , of course I do . - When did you last see her ? - Yesterday . I had a small reception here and she was the guest of honour . You ... you met her here , did n't you ? Oh , yes , the young lady you modelled . Yes . Did you see her leave ? I think so . Why , yes . Yes , I 'm sure I did . What 's happened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . She has just disappeared . It seems the last time she was seen was here at your reception . But that 's terrible . What could have happened ? Quite a number ofthings could have happened , Mademoiselle , and it 's up to me to find out the one that did . This statue you did of her , could I see it ? - Why ? - I understand it 's an excellent likeness . As I have never seen the young lady it would help me in my investigations if I knew what she looked like . I ... I 'm afraid , Inspector , I no longer have the statue . But I just ... Yes , Monsieur ? You were going to say ? Nothing , nothing at all . It does n't matter . Perhaps you can tell me who does have it . Nobody . A stupid accident this morning . It was broken . I was touching up a section ofthe plinth and I knocked the whole thing over . I 'm afraid it was smashed to pieces . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur . That will be all for the moment . You will let me know ifthere 's any news ? - I 'll let you know . - Thank you . - Good night , Inspector . - Good night , sir . - And thank you . - Not at all . - What could have happened to her ? - You know the statue is in the laboratory ? - Yes . Yes , I do . - He only wanted to look at it . He would have wanted to take it away with him . I know how the police mind works and , I 'm afraid , I know myself . It 's probably very silly of me but ... I simply can not part with my sculptures . I see your point . Well , thank you for the dinner , Bonner . Janine . Good night , Professor . - Good night , Gerard . - Good night . - Well ? - He 'll do it . Oh , good . What happened to the girl ? When is he going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to you , not the policeman . What happened to her ? What is the matter with you , Ludwig ? I will tell you what 's the matter with me . Ten years ago when I came to London to do the operation a girl you modelled just disappeared and was never seen again . Ten years before that another ofyour models just disappeared . Two could be a coincidence . Three can not . What have you done to her ? You 're very tired , Ludwig . So am I . You should go to bed . I 'm not tired , I 'm frightened . Frightened for you , what you might have done . Good night , Ludwig . - When is he going to operate ? - Tomorrow morning . I thought I told you to go to bed . Are you going to take another dose ofthe fluid ? You 'd better go to bed , unless you want to see what happens when the dose is overdue . I have been examining the gland . - What about it ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , do n't distress yourself . It will do what is wanted of it . - I am not referring to that . - Then what are you referring to ? This gland is not like the others . It was taken from a ... from a living body . - You 're talking nonsense , Ludwig . - Do n't tell me nonsense . I am not such a senile old fool that I have forgotten the difference between a revitalised and a living organ . This gland has been taken from a living body . All right , Ludwig . As you say , it was taken from a living body . But it was because ofyou that I had to do it . Now it 's my turn to say " nonsense " . You were due here three weeks ago . As always , I had a uter-parathyroid ready . As always , I had removed it and revitalised it , but ... you did n't arrive . I managed to keep that gland revitalised for four days . Then another one . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them die , and still you did n't arrive . I just ... I just could n't get access ... to any more cadavers . No . Oh , no , this ... This was the only answer . The answer for whom ? For you ? Or for the poor man you have murdered ? But I 'm sorry . It was my fault , was n't it ? You had to do it because of me . No , Georges . I ca n't see how this can be justified . You would rather I had not been able to get a gland at all . You would rather this was the end . Is that what you would have liked ? Yes . It is . Knowing how it would happen you still say that ? But I 'm not afraid of death . If I were , I too could have remained young . Do you remember how we talked about it and you tried to persuade me ? But what is death that it should be feared so much ? You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am saying . Why should the death ofthe other man be of less importance than your own death ? By what right can you decide a thing like this ? This is a thing that only God can decide . Have you become God all of a sudden , to judge that you are more important than the other man ? Of course I 'm more important . He was nothing , nothing at all . A nonentity . He had just as much right to life as you have , more perhaps , because he did n't attempt to tamper with the progression of life . While you are on this pedestal of moral indignation you seem to have forgotten that you are as involved as I am . No . I do not forget . That is perhaps because I am so sad . I am sad for you too . You have changed so much . I 'll tell you why I have changed . It 's being alone , so utterly alone , again and again . Every few years having to sever all contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new life . You knew this would be the case when you set out . Knowing something and living with it are are two very different things . I often think I ca n't bear it any longer . Georges ? We have come to a time where we must consider with great care whether what we are doing should continue . No , let me say what I have to . No man can live alone all his life . It 's not natural . It rebels against human nature . But as long as you continue you must remain alone . No . No , there is an answer . Not to continue . No , to continue . But not to continue alone . Georges , you 're not being serious . Of course I 'm serious . Do you think I 've never thought about it ? This must be the answer . Georges . What you are suggesting is monstrous . But why ? Why is it monstrous to want to be with the person you love , always ? Mademoiselle Janine ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not hear of it and I must ask you to promise me now not to consider it again . I can not promise that . Then you are truly alone now . For I will have nothing more to do with it . Ludwig . No , Georges , you must n't do it . Do n't be stupid , Ludwig . Give me that key . Give me that key . It is past time already . Yes , Georges , it 's been many years past time . Ludwig , that key , quickly . All right , I promise . Now , give me that key . You 're lying . I can see it in your eyes . You are lying to save yourself . Give me that key ! Ludwig . Look . Please . No . It is better that it end here before further damage is done . This must be the end . No , you must ... You must n't do it . You fool ! This ... - This is all I 've got . - Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years to make a fresh supply . No , no . No , do n't . Do n't do it . ( Screams ) ( @knock_at_door ) Dr Gerard , sir . Oh . - Good morning , Dr Gerard . - Good morning . Everything is ready , including the patient . Where is Dr Weiss ? Oh , I 'm afraid he had to leave late last night . He received an urgent message from his home in Vienna . He asked me to ... to apologise on his behalf . Monsieur Bonner . Without Dr Weiss it is out ofthe question for me to perform this operation . Last night you agreed . The Doctor 's reputation is such that under his patronage I agreed to do it , but if he is not here , it 's ... it 's impossible . You must or I shall die . I recommend you to see another doctor . Wait . - I 'll pay you well . - That 's of no consequence , Monsieur . Ifyou are in the critical condition that you say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable hospital immediately . It 's possible that they may be able to do for you what I can not do . Good day . - ( @knock_at_door ) - Come in . Inspector Legris to see you , sir . Oh , yes . Show him in . Good morning , sir . - I hope you 'll forgive this intrusion . - Morning . - Please sit down . - Thank you . - What can I do for you ? - This is a little difficult , sir . Are you a particular friend of Monsieur Georges Bonner ? No , I 'm not . I only met him for the first time the day before yesterday . Then there 's not much you can tell me about him . No . When we met last night I received the impression that you wanted to say something . Yes , that 's quite correct , Inspector . Remember that statue that he said was broken ? Well , he did n't break it . It 's in his laboratory . That 's strange . I take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir , we have n't . And you think Bonner knows something that will help you ? I do n't know what to think . The deeper I get into this case , the more complicated and unreasonable it becomes . Unreasonable , Inspector ? How old would you say Monsieur Bonner was ? - About 35 . - Yes , that 's what I would have said . Why do you ask that ? Look , sir , I need your help , I do n't mind admitting it . - To find this girl ? - No , it goes deeper than that . Far deeper . I 'm going to tell you something and then perhaps you may be able to give me the help that I need . Please do . Ten years ago in London a young woman disappeared , later presumed to have been murdered . That 's not very interesting , you 'll say . It happens all the time . Well , exactly ten years before that the same thing happened in San Francisco and ten years before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , two years ago , the international files at the Surete were being tabulated . A fact was noticed that tied these three disappearances together and pointed towards them all having been perpetrated by one man . In each case the girl in question had been posing for a statue prior to her disappearance . In each case the sculptor was a doctor . And in each case the doctor disappeared shortly after . All this is carrying coincidence too far . You see what I 'm getting at , do n't you , sir ? Yes . I see what you 're trying to get at . But if Bonner is the man you suspect , sir , - he 'd be over 60 by now . - Yes . That 's where the whole thing becomes unreasonable . You said yourselfthat he was about 35 , certainly not more than 38 , and I agree with you . I assume you have n't said anything to Bonner about this ? What 's the point ? These statues ofthe women who disappeared , - were they ever found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues were seen by a small number of close friends ofthe sculptor and remarkably fine pieces of work they were too by all account . Then they were never seen again . How can I help you , Inspector ? Well , as you 've met Monsieur Bonner , I had hoped that you might be able to give me a lead . I have checked his background thoroughly . His movements seem all perfectly normal as far as I can trace back . And then I reach a complete dead end . How far back before you reach this dead end ? Ten years . Look , I think I may be able to give you some sort of lead . It may not mean anything but it 's worth a try . See what you can find out about Professor Ludwig Weiss . - You 've heard of him , of course ? - Weiss ? Vaguely . - He 's a doctor , is n't he ? - He was one ofthe very greatest . He was at Bonner 's house last night . You saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , San Francisco and Bern at the time that those girls disappeared . You do n't think Professor Weiss could have been responsible ? No , I do n't , not directly . But you will try ? Dr Gerard , I 'll try anything . Needless to say , you wo n't say a word about this to anyone , will you ? Naturally not , Inspector , if_that is your wish . Thank you . I do n't know your reasons for wanting me to do this , Monsieur Dumont , but whatever they are , I must decline . I 'm sorry . But you 're not making sense , Pierre . You come here with a story which you admit is mostly guesswork and you expect me to believe it . All I 'm trying to do is to warn you against Georges Bonner . I gathered that , but you still have n't explained why . I ca n't give you all the details until I am sure of_them myself . But ... the man 's abnormal . For heaven 's sake , Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to perform an operation on Bonner . I agreed , and today Weiss is n't there anymore . Well ? What 's so mysterious about that ? By itself , nothing , but added to other things that I have discovered ... Oh , not that idiotic story about those statues again . I 've never heard anyone talk such nonsense in all my life . I admit it does sound far-fetched . That is why I want you to wait ... until I can get more information . Spy on him . That 's what you mean , do n't you ? You came to make an impression upon me with your story about Georges . Well , you 've done that . But it was about you and not Georges that you made the impression . You are jealous of him . You 're jealous of his work and about me . Well , I love him . And I 'm going to marry him . It 's unusual , Monsieur Dumont . You will grant me that . So is the fee I am offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . When is it to be ? I , er ... I think I could manage next Tuesday . It is to be now , tonight , and at my place . Very well , then . I 'll put my things together . One needs many instruments for an operation . What 's this ? This is a scalpel , Monsieur Dumont . You could n't be expected to know what that is but to us doctors it is the principal instrument , like a spade is to a farmer , you know . And just about as filthy too . Leave all this . I have all the equipment you need . You have ? Very well . I always have a small one before I operate . My hand is not as steady as it was , you know . Wait for me . Oh ... Oh , Janine . I 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . I hope you do n't mind my coming here like this . No , of course not . I was looking for you all afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I have been busy . Janine , there is something I must tell you . I ... Georges , are you ill ? No , no , of course not . - Why ? - Oh , it 's just that ... Pierre was here earlier this afternoon . He said something about an operation . He 's got some fantastic story in his mind about you and Professor Weiss . What sort of story ? Oh , it 's too ridiculous for words . Something to do with glands and statues . I really did n't know what he was talking about . Darling ? - Are you sure you 're not ill ? - No , of course not . I 'm just tired . Yes , just tired . I was so worried about you this afternoon , thinking you were ill and not knowing where you were . - Janine ... - Yes ? - Would you do something for me ? - Anything in the world . Then come with me . Georges , what a strange place . - Is it yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doing here ? I 'll ... I 'll explain in a minute . I love you . But it 's simply wonderful . So many beautiful things . - It must have taken years to do . - Yes , yes , a long time . Wait , I 'll ... I 'll show you something . This is the very first thing I ever did . I was 12 . It 's charming . 1798 ? Oh , Georges , you 've got the wrong date on this . Ifyou modelled this when you were 12 then this date makes you ... 104 . Georges ? Georges ! Yes , I heard what you said . 104 . I do n't believe it . Whether you believe it or not is of no importance . It is important that you do this operation . My answer is the same as before , Bonner . No . Wait a minute , Gerard . Listen to me once more . Then we 'll see ifyou feel the same afterwards . Weiss and I ... were fellow students . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yes , his senior . I met him when I returned to university for a refresher course on surgery . Quite by accident we discovered we were interested in the same line of research . And then ... finally we discovered the secret of immortal life . But we had to prove what up till then had been only theory . So ... I volunteered to be the first guinea pig . Since I embarked on this experiment , I have never been ill , never had a blemish on my skin . Sickness and disease have passed me by . So you see , not only did we discover the secret of perpetual life , but of perpetual health as well . Then why did n't you publish your findings ? We have n't published because to do so would bring disaster . The balance of nature is such that the population ofthe world is kept at a level where the world can adequately provide food and living space for our people . If it were suddenly made possible for people to remain alive and healthy indefinitely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population ofthe earth would be doubled , then quadrupled . There would be famine on a scale never before dreamed of . This is one reason we have n't published . - One reason ? - Yes . There is another . Every ten years it is necessary to have the uter-parathyroid replaced . In order to replace an organ you must first find a replacement . With no one dying there would be no replacement . You told me earlier on about a fluid that you have to take to keep alive . Only in the latter stages of each ten-year cycle . If , for any reason , the operation is delayed , it is possible to remain alive for four weeks by taking this fluid . Not desirable , for it has an unpredictable effect on the mental balance . And you have none ofthis fluid left ? Enough to keep me alive for another six hours . I shall become the inheritor of all my 104 years , of all the sickness I have never had , of every pain , blemish , disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why you must perform this operation . I 'm sorry , Bonner , but I still ca n't do it . Why not ? Tell me why not . You are asking me to participate in an offence against nature . You said so yourself . An offence against God . Nothing you can say will make me change my mind . You 're in love with Janine , are n't you ? Yes , I am . You would n't like anything to happen to her ? What do you mean ? At this moment Janine is somewhere only I know . Ifyou perform this operation and perform it successfully , I shall release her . Ifyou do n't perform this operation , or if anything should happen to me while you are operating , Janine will not be seen by you or anyone else again . You have two hours to verify the facts . Then I shall expect you at my house . Two hours . Remember . Here you are , dearie . Drink it up . Why ? What 's the hurry ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working girl , remember . Time is money after all . You 'll get paid so stop nagging . ( @door_opens ) Cognac . I 'm sick of waiting here for you to fill your great fat stomach . - I 'm going . - What are you doing ?

My escort 's here now , anyway . ( Catscreeches ) Mind the dustbins , dear . ( @woman_screams ) ( @doorbell_rings ) Never mind , Roger . You go to bed . Yes , sir . Good evening .

How does it feel ? I said , how does it feel ? - Did you see Bonner go out ? - No . I heard him , though . - Have you any idea where he went ? - No , sir , I have n't . Find Inspector Legris and bring him here . - Yes , sir . - And hurry . It 's desperately urgent . ( Trainpassing ) ( Gruntingandgroaning ) - Where have you been ? - Later . Come on .

Wait a minute , sir . Please will you start at the beginning ? Earlier this evening Bonner came to see me . He asked me to perform an operation on him . This has been my ... existence . Not life , existence . Until I met you . Now you 're going to come with me , Janine . But first you must become exactly as I am . Think of it . Never to grow old , always to stay as we are , as we are now , never to be ill . To stay as beautiful as you are now . - No . - Always . Through all time . And this fluid affected his reason ?

The missis went away this morning . I do n't know where . The mister called this afternoon . It sounded like long distance . He said , " Do n't wait with dinner . " We fixed for Miss Trimingham early . Miss Trimingham ? Yes . Come on , Josephine . Help me with these bags . You 'll find your old room , just exactly the way you left it . Nellie , who 's Miss Trimingham ? - She 's your mother 's trained nurse . - Trained nurse ? For the drinking , Mr . Alfred . Alfred . Oh , my Alfred ! Mother , you all right ? Oh , forgive me . How horrible . I 'm so excited and awkward . - Oh , but you 're home . - Yes , Mother . Oh , darling , do n't . Do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . I 'm so tired , and I 'm not feeling well . Could n't we save everything for tomorrow , when I 'll be at my best ? We 'll make believe there was no tonight and that you came home tomorrow and we 'll say all our hellos as they should be . - Sure , Mother . Here comes your father . Now make allowances . He 's not at his best . Here we are , Sam , and look who 's with me . - My boy . Home at last . - Hello , Father . Hello , Father ? Is that all after all this time ? - No . There 's a lot more . - Yes , I should think there would be . - Now what 've you done to yourself ? - She just tripped and fell . - Does n't he look wonderful ? - Yes . Let 's get in the house . Now , Sam , what we 've decided is we 're not going to say our hellos tonight . We 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a daisy . How was the war ? OK , I guess . We won it . Oh , have you met my son ? Alfred , this is Miss Trimingham . - How do you do ? - Welcome home . Up we go . Cool sheets and heavenly rest . Good night , Alfred . Sleep as late as you like and remember , you 're coming home tomorrow . Tonight never even happened . The house looks good . Yeah . Your mother touched it up a bit here and there . - You 've put on a couple ofpounds . - Soft living in the navy . I suppose you 're sleepy . I was up at quarter to 6:oo this morning . - Not a very good time to talk now anyway , is it ? No , I guess it is n't . I guess I 'll go upstairs , too . If it 's all right with you . - Father ? - Yeah ? Nothing . Good night . Good night . She does n't need you now . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home again and seeing your mother and father ? Things do n't change , Nellie . They just get more so . We got ginger ale , seltzer , and no liquor . Where 's the liquor ? Your father keeps it under lock and key . - Good night , Mr . Alfred . - Good night . Even the servants in your own house , know about you . I 'm tired . I 'm sick . Leave me alone . I 'll leave you alone when you tell me everything I want to know . - Who else saw you together ? - Nobody else . Not a soul . - You were in restaurants together . - Never . Wallowing in filth together ! - And I want to know where every damn place ! - No . - Well , you 're going to tell me . - Oh no , Sam , not tonight . Please . - Where else did you meet him ? - Nowhere else . Only his house . You 're lying to me . You were with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could stay with him and me the same night ? Yes ! Did you think you 're any better , than one of those sluts on River Street ? I 'm not proud of myself . Not proud of herself , she says . - How can you look at your own son ? - I ca n't . If that egotistical little father of yours was alive to know about this ... Yourson . Your father . Your heroes . I have no heroes , only some people I love . - You were my hero . - Shut up ! And you drove me to it . You turned your back on me just like you did on Alfred . I needed love wherever I could find it . Love ! You 're a pig . I ca n't stand the sight of you . Mr Eaton . His name is Charles Frolick . - He 's a terrible , evil man . - How long has it been going on ? About a year . She 's been trying not to see him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Frolick ? Number 22 Walnut Street , Philadelphia . - Yes , what is it ? - Are you Charles Frolick ? I am . What kind of an hour of the night ... - Who the devil are you ? - Charlie . What do you think you 're doing here ? Charlie ! My name is Alfred Eaton . Alfred Eaton . You got that ? Now , you go near my mother again , I 'll kill you . Charlie ? What 's the big idea ofkeeping me ... Charlie ! - Mr . Alfred down yet ? - He 's having breakfast , sir . There you are , boy . - Watch those eggs , Nellie . - Yes , Mr Eaton . Well , how did it feel sleeping in your own bed ? You mother wanted to buy a new mattress , but I said no . I slept very well . Thank you . Well , I did n't . It 's not as easy as it used to be . Still , I guess I 'm all right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tail off during the war . I might even get a chance to rest . We all are , in our business . Big contracts canceled months ago and now those darn fool workers are going to strike . Let them . There 'll be nothing , but gas in their kids ' bellies by the time they come back . Pay them exactly what you want . What do you care ? I care because I 'm against anybody going on strike against me . You 'll know what I feel , when you come into the business with me . - Well , I suppose you 're thinking of taking it easy . - Not exactly . Maybe traveling a bit , seeing something of the country before settling down here . We got to start thinking of a club in Philadelphia for you . I doubt I 'll be joining a club , but if I do , it 'll probably be in New York . New York ? What for ? I expect to be spending some time there . I thought you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't . My home base will be in New York . - The hell it will . - The hell it wo n't ! I guess I do n't feel like having any breakfast . Tell them in the kitchen I 'm not staying . Do n't you want to hear what my plans are ? I 'm in no hurry to . I can see you wo n't do what I 'd hoped and you have n't discussed it with me . I 'd be glad to discuss it . You want to tell me to go to the devil and take the mill with me . You 've been wanting to do that all your life . All I wanted to do is to be friends with you . That 's what you want , friendship ? I have n't got a friend for every 10 years I 've lived . I hoped for that , too . First , you 'll have to show me you 're a man I 'd want to be friends with . The job at the mill was yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would come out of what , being your errand boy ? You never asked me what I wanted to do . Now I 'm supposed to go into the mill to please you . You 'd cripple me for life . You do n't think I can make it on my own . You 're not big enough to even walk in my shadow and you never will be . Alfred . So much shouting so early in the day with the servants around , too . I guess we 're not a very respectable family , are we ? - You must give him time . - For what ? He 'll never change . He might get used to your ways . I do n't think I have that much time . Neither has he . There 's a lot of sadness and sweetness in you , Alfred , but you can be very cruel and cold sometimes . Oh nice , kind Alfred . Did I just say something awful ? - I 'm sorry . - Nothing for you to be sorry about . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to be nice and I do n't even remember what made me change . Do n't be hard on yourself . I know a lot more than you think I do . You 're still my mother . What do you know ? Everything . Oh , God . Put your arms around me , Alfred . - Do you still like me a little ? - I love you , Mother . Even when I 'm like this ? - You 're leaving us , are n't you , Alfred ? - Yes . Where are you going ? I may stay with Lex Porter in New York for a while . I suppose you 'll see the Thorntons . Fritz Thornton is throwing a party for Lex tonight in Southampton . The Porters and the Thorntons are like a second family to you , but just remember , they 're not . Do n't get too independent . Do n't cut off your own flesh and blood . Anybody can disappoint you , if you catch them at the wrong time and that includes you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think your mother ought to be . I 'm sorry if it embarrasses you and I 'm not going to make any excuses . Do n't worry . That 's not why I 'm leaving . I could feel it last night your very first look at me down in the driveway . What am I ? Ahopeless drunkard ? They 'd rather have me that than the other thing an unfaithful wife . Apig , he called me . Well , the drinking makes a good cover-up for a lot of things . Goodbye now , Mother . " It would n't have happened if she had n't been a drinker . " " Martha Eaton would n't do such things , if she did n't like gin and whiskey so much . " Well , little do they know . Little does anybody know . - May I have this dance ? - Oh , why , certainly . - Will you pardon me just a moment ? - Sure . Thank you . Are you looking for me ? - I am if yourname is Lex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll change it if you 'll stop looking further . Just how far am I allowed to look ? You 're fresh . - I like you . Sam ? - No , Alfred . Are you going to make a pass at me ? You believe in long courtships , do n't you ? - Who 's got time ? I 'm crowding 19 . - What , years or guys ? Nasty . Come on . Let 's dance and crowd each other . I better go fill my wooden leg . You mean it 's all over between us ? Well , these things do n't last forever . Waiter , tell me where I can find Mr Porter . He went into the den a few minutes ago , sir . - Excuse me . - Hey , wait a minute . - Alfred , when did you get here ? - Couple of minutes ago . Come in . Join us . Alfred Eaton , Sage Rimmington . - Sorry . - So am I . Sage , this is the rover boy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what lies ahead ? Darling , if you 'll excuse me ... I think I 'll put on something more comfortable . Like my husband . Bye , sweetie . - I like that . - Oh , she 's very inventive . - How was it , boy ? - How was what ? - Getting home . - Great . Yeah , me , too . I snapped out of it , though . Good booze , bad women . It never fails to work . How did things go in the money department ? Our project . Did you raise the dough ? Oh , your old man . Well , I 'll have another little talk with Uncle Fritz . I 'll just charm him into putting up the whole 500,000 . I do n't want that . I know you do n't , sport , but have we got any choice ? I do n't mean to sound ungrateful , but let 's wait till I can swing my own end . I 'm not going into any business venture , where I carry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't mean that much to me . It does to me . Boy , you did have a rough time at home , did n't you ? We got to get you out of there . - I 've already taken care of that . - Really ? - What are your plans ? - I do n't know . I was sort of , thinking about that bachelor apartment you were going to set up in Gramercy Park . Hey , now you 're talking . Play it by ear for a while . Well , you can use your ear . I got better ideas . Let 's start right now . Now , would you look at this ? 200 beautiful Long Island virgins . Markel 's dance music , buckets of champagne ... and I 'm the guest of honor . Now , how can I lose ? Unless I start getting drunk and taking those little girls upstairs . - I met something called Clemmie . - Oh , ClemmieShreve . Now , I 'm saving that for a rainy night . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 'm so glad to see you . - Mr Thornton , how are you ? This party would n't be complete without you . Champagne for three . - Have they been treating you properly here ? - No complaints . I hope you 'll stay with us for a good long visit . - I may take you up on that . - I hoped for this moment . The three of us together like this as I hoped for victory . God bless you . - Thought I might as well start at the top . - Did you ? Pretty close to it . Thanks for the compliment . Who are you ? Alfred Eaton . That would n't mean anything to you . What 's your name ? - Mary St . John . - That 's a nice , respectable name . Well , of course it 's respectable . That 's a silly thing to say . Am I the first to call it respectable ? You 're the first who ever raised the question . Then I 'm glad I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to annoy me , you 're succeeding . My manners are rusty . You 're the first girl I 've danced with for a long time . Why did n't you bestow that honor on someone inside instead of here on the terrace ? I rather like the view from the terrace . Then I saw you and I liked the view even more . You touch me deeply . But not in the right places . Well , that was reasonably disagreeable . Yes , and it was so easy . Would you like to go cry or something ? No , but I would n't mind , if you faded away into the sunset . Here comes the bird dog , to retrieve you . What 's his name ? - Jim Roper . , - Oh , grim Jim Roper ? No . Dr Roper . He 's a psychiatrist . Oh , sorry . I hope you get well very soon . Good night , Mr Eaton . Good night , Miss St . John . All yours , Doctor . I know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard they were like minks during the war . - How are you doing ? - You tell me . Who 's Mary St . John ? Her old man 's with the DuPont Corporation down in Wilmington . - Fancy pedigree . - Papers on both sides . - Hey , waiter . You can forget about her . - Why ? - You want one ? - No . She 's secretly engaged to the guy she 's with , the doctor , Jim Roper . I do n't think he 's rich enough for her , but if it is n't him it 'll be somebody else who is . If you 're not thinking about marrying her , you can forget about anything else . She 's really saving it . - Want to make a little bet ? - Oh , wake up , sport . You have n't got the necessary qualifications . Well , there are all kinds of qualifications . And straight ahead you 'll notice the famous Whitney estate . Oh , and there to the right is the estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chimney ? In all probability Mr MacHardie is burning money . Stop hiding behind the glasses . I 'm not hiding . You always manage to put something between us like Jim Roper , or your friend Sage Rimmington , or the net of a tennis court . What are you afraid of ? - Let 's row back to shore shall we ? - See what I mean ? I do n't know why you bother talking to me . Every time you do , you get sarcastic and we end up fighting . Now , if you do n't approve of me , just leave me alone . I 'm sure I wo n't perish from unhappiness . This is the first time we 've been alone . - How long are you going to be here ? - A month or so . Then back to Wilmington ? I used to live very close to there Port Johnson , Pennsylvania . I thought you lived in New York , in Gramercy Park , with Lex and all the stray girls you could lay your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go back . - You do n't mean that . - Yes , I do mean that . I knew you would kiss me today , but I did n't know I 'd kiss you back . It wo n't happen again so do n't try to get me alone somewhere . - You 'd like that . - Stop it . - Why ? - ' Cause I 'm engaged to Jim Roper . - You going to marry him ? - Well , I 'm engaged to him . But you did n't say you were going to marry him . Are you going to row me back to shore or am I going to have to swim back ? Swim . Hello , Alfred . - Who is it , Mary ? - It 's just a friend , Mother . Well , who is it , Mary ? I think you better come in . Mother , this is Alfred Eaton . My mother . - How do you do ? - Mr Eaton . And my father . Daddy , Alfred Eaton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe we 've seen you before . - Are you from these parts ? - Port Johnson , Pennsylvania . Oh , yes . The steel mill . So , you 're that Eaton . What do you think of the strike ? I 'm not in the mill , but my father does n't like it . I should n't think he would . Well , what brings you to Wilmington at this awkward hour ? I was just duck hunting on my way to New York . Thought I 'd say hello to Mary . - How was the shooting ? - Got a few tail feathers . How is Jim ? - Jim ? - Yes . - You mean Jim Roper ? - Yes . I assume you 're close friends . Not exactly . Oh , well , now , not a friend ofJim's . - Is n't that a bit strange ? - No , Mother . Jim and I met Alfred at the same time . - Then he 's really a friend of yours , more than Jim's . - That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill . What do you do ? I mean , besides duck hunting in the middle of the week . Actually , I 've got some exciting business plans . - I 'm not allowed to disclose them now . - I see . Well , I guess I better be going . My husband will see you to the door . - No , I will . - Good night , sir . - Good night . - Good night , Mrs St . John . - Goodbye , Mr Eaton . Your mother and father are sort of distant . Now , what do you mean by that ? You know what I mean . You never did believe I was going to marry Jim , did you ? I wrote him a letter and I broke up with him . Why did n't you tell me ? I do n't know . I did n't tell anybody . Alfred ? Are you going to do something and be somebody ? - For you ? - Yes . - Settle down ? - Yes . With you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . More than anything in the whole world . Mary ? You 're never going to want anybody else as long as you live . You better go in now . I should think he 'd know better . - He wanted to see me . - And you should , too . I happen to like Alfred , Mother . The Eatons are nothing and nobody . The motheris a drunkard . The father is a nouveau riche war profiteer . How do you know ? You have n't met them . I have sources of information . If he were a gentleman , he 'd stay away before people start talking . We do n't want him . That 's all there is to it . That is n't all there is to it . - I 've broken my engagement to Jim . - I ca n't believe it . Mary ... I forbid you to see this man again . I do n't like that word forbid . It makes me want to disobey you . In that case , I shall have a talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the young man , but you 've given me an idea . Do n't do that , father ! It 's my life ! I do n't have to take that kind of talk from Eugene St . John or any of that DuPont crowd ! - You did n't . You hung up on him . - If you 'd stayed where you belong ... - Maybe I do n't like where I belong . - That 's what sours your insides that my blood and your mother 's is running through your veins . That 's why you get mixed up with a family who does n't want you . - I 'm not interested in her family ! - You ca n't buy respectability by slipping a wedding ring on it . Sometimes you end up with what you 're running from . - And remember , I told you . - If you 're through , I 'm going . Where , back to that apartment your friend Porter and all those questionable goings-on ? You have n't done an honest day 's work since
